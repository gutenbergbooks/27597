<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
This book is a sequel to my <i>History of English Thought in the
Eighteenth Century</i>. The title which I then ventured to use was more
comprehensive than the work itself deserved: I felt my inability to
write a continuation which should at all correspond to a similar title
for the nineteenth century. I thought, however, that by writing an
account of the compact and energetic school of English Utilitarians I
could throw some light both upon them and their contemporaries. I had
the advantage for this purpose of having been myself a disciple of the
school during its last period. Many accidents have delayed my
completion of the task; and delayed also its publication after it was
written. Two books have been published since that time, which partly
cover the same ground; and I must be content with referring my readers
to them for further information. They are <i>The English Radicals</i>, by
Mr. C. B. Roylance Kent; and <i>English Political Philosophy from Hobbes
to Maine</i>, by Professor Graham.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg 1]</a></span>
The English Utilitarians of whom I am about to give some account were
a group of men who for three generations had a conspicuous influence
upon English thought and political action. Jeremy Bentham, James Mill,
and John Stuart Mill were successively their leaders; and I shall
speak of each in turn. It may be well to premise a brief indication of
the method which I have adopted. I have devoted a much greater
proportion of my work to biography and to consideration of political
and social conditions than would be appropriate to the history of a
philosophy. The reasons for such a course are very obvious in this
case, inasmuch as the Utilitarian doctrines were worked out with a
constant reference to practical applications. I think, indeed, that
such a reference is often equally present, though not equally
conspicuous, in other philosophical schools. But in any case I wish to
show how I conceive the relation of my scheme to the scheme more
generally adopted by historians of abstract speculation.</p>

<p>I am primarily concerned with the history of a school or sect, not
with the history of the arguments by which it justifies itself in the
court of pure reason. I must therefore consider the creed as it was
actually embodied in the dominant beliefs of the adherents of the
school, not as it was expounded in lecture-rooms or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> treatises on
first principles. I deal not with philosophers meditating upon Being
and not-Being, but with men actively engaged in framing political
platforms and carrying on popular agitations. The great majority even
of intelligent partisans are either indifferent to the philosophic
creed of their leaders or take it for granted. Its postulates are more
or less implied in the doctrines which guide them in practice, but are
not explicitly stated or deliberately reasoned out. Not the less the
doctrines of a sect, political or religious, may be dependent upon
theories which for the greater number remain latent or are recognised
only in their concrete application. Contemporary members of any
society, however widely they differ as to results, are employed upon
the same problems and, to some extent, use the same methods and make
the same assumptions in attempting solutions. There is a certain unity
even in the general thought of any given period. Contradictory views
imply some common ground. But within this wider unity we find a
variety of sects, each of which may be considered as more or less
representing a particular method of treating the general problem: and
therefore principles which, whether clearly recognised or not, are
virtually implied in their party creed and give a certain unity to
their teaching.</p>

<p>One obvious principle of unity, or tacit bond of sympathy which holds
a sect together depends upon the intellectual idiosyncrasy of the
individuals. Coleridge was aiming at an important truth when he said
that every man was born an Aristotelian or a Platonist.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Nominalists
and realists, intuitionists and empiricists, idealists and
materialists, represent different forms of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
a fundamental antithesis
which appears to run through all philosophy. Each thinker is apt to
take the postulates congenial to his own mind as the plain dictates of
reason. Controversies between such opposites appear to be hopeless.
They have been aptly compared by Dr. Venn to the erection of a
snow-bank to dam a river. The snow melts and swells the torrent which
it was intended to arrest. Each side reads admitted truths into its
own dialect, and infers that its own dialect affords the only valid
expression. To regard such antitheses as final and insoluble would be
to admit complete scepticism. What is true for one man would not
therefore be true&mdash;or at least its truth would not be demonstrable&mdash;to
another. We must trust that reconciliation is achievable by showing
that the difference is really less vital and corresponds to a
difference of methods or of the spheres within which each mode of
thought may be valid. To obtain the point of view from which such a
conciliation is possible should be, I hold, one main end of modern
philosophising.</p>

<p>The effect of this profound intellectual difference is complicated by
other obvious influences. There is, in the first place, the difference
of intellectual horizon. Each man has a world of his own and sees a
different set of facts. Whether his horizon is that which is visible
from his parish steeple or from St. Peter's at Rome, it is still
strictly limited: and the outside universe, known vaguely and
indirectly, does not affect him like the facts actually present to his
perception. The most candid thinkers will come to different
conclusions when they are really provided with different sets of fact.
In political and social problems every man's opinions are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
moulded by
his social station. The artisan's view of the capitalist, and the
capitalist's view of the artisan, are both imperfect, because each has
a first-hand knowledge of his own class alone: and, however anxious to
be fair, each will take a very different view of the working of
political institutions. An apparent concord often covers the widest
divergence under the veil of a common formula, because each man has
his private mode of interpreting general phrases in terms of concrete
fact.</p>

<p>This, of course, implies the further difference arising from the
passions which, however illogically, go so far to determine opinions.
Here we have the most general source of difficulty in considering the
actual history of a creed. We cannot limit ourselves to the purely
logical factor. All thought has to start from postulates. Men have to
act before they think: before, at any rate, reasoning becomes distinct
from imagining or guessing. To explain in early periods is to fancy
and to take a fancy for a perception. The world of the primitive man
is constructed not only from vague conjectures and hasty analogies but
from his hopes and fears, and bears the impress of his emotional
nature. When progress takes place some of his beliefs are confirmed,
some disappear, and others are transformed: and the whole history of
thought is a history of this gradual process of verification. We
begin, it is said, by assuming: we proceed by verifying, and we only
end by demonstrating. The process is comparatively simple in that part
of knowledge which ultimately corresponds to the physical sciences.
There must be a certain harmony between beliefs and realities in
regard to knowledge of ordinary matters of fact, if only because such
harmony is essential
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
to the life of the race. Even an ape must
distinguish poisonous from wholesome food. Beliefs as to physical
facts require to be made articulate and distinct; but we have only to
recognise as logical principles the laws of nature which we have
unconsciously obeyed and illustrated&mdash;to formulate dynamics long after
we have applied the science in throwing stones or using bows and
arrows. But what corresponds to this in the case of the moral and
religious beliefs? What is the process of verification? Men
practically are satisfied with their creed so long as they are
satisfied with the corresponding social order. The test of truth so
suggested is obviously inadequate: for all great religions, however
contradictory to each other, have been able to satisfy it for long
periods. Particular doctrines might be tested by experiment. The
efficacy of witchcraft might be investigated like the efficacy of
vaccination. But faith can always make as many miracles as it wants:
and errors which originate in the fancy cannot be at once extirpated
by the reason. Their form may be changed but not their substance. To
remove them requires not disproof of this or that fact, but an
intellectual discipline which is rare even among the educated classes.
A religious creed survives, as poetry or art survives,&mdash;not so long as
it contains apparently true statements of fact but&mdash;so long as it is
congenial to the whole social state. A philosophy indeed is a poetry
stated in terms of logic. Considering the natural conservatism of
mankind, the difficulty is to account for progress, not for the
persistence of error. When the existing order ceases to be
satisfactory; when conquest or commerce has welded nations together
and brought conflicting creeds into cohesion; when industrial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
development has modified the old class relations; or when the
governing classes have ceased to discharge their functions, new
principles are demanded and new prophets arise. The philosopher may
then become the mouthpiece of the new order, and innocently take
himself to be its originator. His doctrines were fruitless so long as
the soil was not prepared for the seed. A premature discovery if not
stamped out by fire and sword is stifled by indifference. If Francis
Bacon succeeded where Roger Bacon failed, the difference was due to
the social conditions, not to the men. The cause of the great
religious as well as of the great political revolutions must be sought
mainly in the social history. New creeds spread when they satisfy the
instincts or the passions roused to activity by other causes. The
system has to be so far true as to be credible at the time; but its
vitality depends upon its congeniality as a whole to the aspirations
of the mass of mankind.</p>

<p>The purely intellectual movement no doubt represents the decisive
factor. The love of truth in the abstract is probably the weakest of
human passions; but truth when attained ultimately gives the fulcrum
for a reconstruction of the world. When a solid core of ascertained
and verifiable truth has once been formed and applied to practical
results it becomes the fixed pivot upon which all beliefs must
ultimately turn. The influence, however, is often obscure and still
indirect. The more cultivated recognise the necessity of bringing
their whole doctrine into conformity with the definitely organised and
established system; and, at the present day, even the uneducated begin
to have an inkling of possible results. Yet the desire for logical
consistency is not one which presses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
forcibly upon the less
cultivated intellects. They do not feel the necessity of unifying
knowledge or bringing their various opinions into consistency and into
harmony with facts. There are easy methods of avoiding any troublesome
conflict of belief. The philosopher is ready to show them the way. He,
like other people, has to start from postulates, and to see how they
will work. When he meets with a difficulty it is perfectly legitimate
that he should try how far the old formula can be applied to cover the
new applications. He may be led to a process of 'rationalising' or
'spiritualising' which is dangerous to intellectual honesty. The
vagueness of the general conceptions with which he is concerned
facilitates the adaptation; and his words slide into new meanings by
imperceptible gradations. His error is in taking a legitimate
tentative process for a conclusive test; and inferring that opinions
are confirmed because a non-natural interpretation can be forced upon
them. This, however, is only the vicious application of the normal
process through which new ideas are diffused or slowly infiltrate the
old systems till the necessity of a thoroughgoing reconstruction
forces itself upon our attention. Nor can it be denied that an
opposite fallacy is equally possible, especially in times of
revolutionary passion. The apparent irreconcilability of some new
doctrine with the old may lead to the summary rejection of the
implicit truth, together with the error involved in its imperfect
recognition. Hence arises the necessity for faking into account not
only a man's intellectual idiosyncrasies and the special intellectual
horizon, but all the prepossessions due to his personal character, his
social environment, and his consequent sympathies and antipathies. The
philosopher has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
his passions like other men. He does not really live
in the thin air of abstract speculation. On the contrary, he starts
generally, and surely is right in starting, with keen interest in the
great religious, ethical, and social problems of the time. He
wishes&mdash;honestly and eagerly&mdash;to try them by the severest tests, and
to hold fast only what is clearly valid. The desire to apply his
principles in fact justifies his pursuit, and redeems him from the
charge that he is delighting in barren intellectual subtleties. But to
an outsider his procedure may appear in a different light. His real
problem comes to be: how the conclusions which are agreeable to his
emotions can be connected with the postulates which are congenial to
his intellect? He may be absolutely honest and quite unconscious that
his conclusions were prearranged by his sympathies. No philosophic
creed of any importance has ever been constructed, we may well
believe, without such sincerity and without such plausibility as
results from its correspondence to at least some aspects of the truth.
But the result is sufficiently shown by the perplexed controversies
which arise. Men agree in their conclusions, though starting from
opposite premises; or from the same premises reach the most diverging
conclusions. The same code of practical morality, it is often said, is
accepted by thinkers who deny each other's first principles; dogmatism
often appears to its opponents to be thoroughgoing scepticism in
disguise, and men establish victoriously results which turn out in the
end to be really a stronghold for their antagonists.</p>

<p>Hence there is a distinction between such a history of a sect as I
contemplate and a history of scientific inquiry or of pure philosophy.
A history of mathematical or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
physical science would differ from a
direct exposition of the science, but only in so far as it would state
truths in the order of discovery, not in the order most convenient for
displaying them as a system. It would show what were the processes by
which they were originally found out, and how they have been
afterwards annexed or absorbed in some wider generalisation. These
facts might be stated without any reference to the history of the
discoverers or of the society to which they belonged. They would
indeed suggest very interesting topics to the general historian or
'sociologist.' He might be led to inquire under what conditions men
came to inquire scientifically at all; why they ceased for centuries
to care for science; why they took up special departments of
investigation; and what was the effect of scientific discoveries upon
social relations in general. But the two inquiries would be distinct
for obvious reasons. If men study mathematics they can only come to
one conclusion. They will find out the same propositions of geometry
if they only think clearly enough and long enough, as certainly as
Columbus would discover America if he only sailed far enough. America
was there, and so in a sense are the propositions. We may therefore in
this case entirely separate the two questions: what leads men to
think? and what conclusions will they reach? The reasons which guided
the first discoverers are just as valid now, though they can be more
systematically stated. But in the 'moral sciences' this distinction is
not equally possible. The intellectual and the social evolution are
closely and intricately connected, and each reacts upon the other. In
the last resort no doubt a definitive system of belief once elaborated
would repose upon universally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
valid truths and determine, instead of
being determined by, the corresponding social order. But in the
concrete evolution which, we may hope, is approximating towards this
result, the creeds current among mankind have been determined by the
social conditions as well as helped to determine them. To give an
account of that process it is necessary to specify the various
circumstances which may lead to the survival of error, and to the
partial views of truth taken by men of different idiosyncrasies
working upon different data and moved by different passions and
prepossessions. A history written upon these terms would show
primarily what, as a fact, were the dominant beliefs during a given
period, and state which survived, which disappeared, and which were
transformed or engrafted upon other systems of thought. This would of
course raise the question of the truth or falsehood of the doctrines
as well as of their vitality: for the truth is at least one essential
condition of permanent vitality. The difference would be that the
problem would be approached from a different side. We should ask first
what beliefs have flourished, and afterwards ask why they flourished,
and how far their vitality was due to their partial or complete truth.
To write such a history would perhaps require an impartiality which
few people possess and which I do not venture to claim. I have my own
opinions for which other people may account by prejudice, assumption,
or downright incapacity. I am quite aware that I shall be implicitly
criticising myself in criticising others. All that I can profess is
that by taking the questions in this order, I shall hope to fix
attention upon one set of considerations which are apt, as I fancy, to
be unduly neglected. The result of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
reading some histories is to raise
the question: how people on the other side came to be such unmitigated
fools? Why were they imposed upon by such obvious fallacies? That may
be answered by considering more fully the conditions under which the
opinions were actually adopted, and one result may be to show that
those opinions had a considerable element of truth, and were held by
men who were the very opposite of fools. At any rate I shall do what I
can to write an account of this phase of thought, so as to bring out
what were its real tenets; to what intellectual type they were
naturally congenial; what were the limitations of view which affected
the Utilitarians' conception of the problems to be solved; and what
were the passions and prepossessions due to the contemporary state of
society and to their own class position, which to some degree
unconsciously dictated their conclusions. So far as I can do this
satisfactorily, I hope that I may throw some light upon the intrinsic
value of the creed, and the place which it should occupy in a
definitive system.

<h3>POLITICAL CONDITIONS</h3>

<p class="scs">I. <a name="I_I" id="I_I"></a>THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
The English Utilitarians represent one outcome of the speculations
current in England during the later part of the eighteenth century.
For the reasons just assigned I shall begin by briefly recalling some
of the social conditions which set the problems for the coming
generation and determined the mode of answering them. I must put the
main facts in evidence, though they are even painfully familiar. The
most obvious starting-point is given by the political situation. The
supremacy of parliament had been definitively established by the
revolution of 1688, and had been followed by the elaboration of the
system of party government. The centre of gravity of the political
world lay in the House of Commons. No minister could hold power unless
he could command a majority in this house. Jealousy of the royal
power, however, was still a ruling passion. The party line between
Whig and Tory turned ostensibly upon this issue. The essential Whig
doctrine is indicated by Dunning's famous resolution (6 April 1780)
that 'the power of the crown had increased, was increasing, and ought
to be diminished.' The resolution
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
was in one sense an anachronism. As
in many other cases, politicians seem to be elaborately slaying the
slain and guarding against the attacks of extinct monsters. There was
scarcely more probability under George <small>III.</small> than there is under
Victoria that the king would try to raise taxes without consent of
parliament. George <small>III.</small>, however, desired to be more than a
contrivance for fixing the great seal to official documents. He had
good reason for thinking that the weakness of the executive was an
evil. The king could gain power not by attacking the authority of
parliament but by gaining influence within its walls. He might form a
party of 'king's friends' able to hold the balance between the
connections formed by the great families and so break up the system of
party government. Burke's great speech (11 Feb. 1780) upon introducing
his plan 'for the better security of the independence of parliament
and the economical reformation of the civil and other establishments'
explains the secret and reveals the state of things which for the next
half century was to supply one main theme for the eloquence of
reformers. The king had at his disposal a vast amount of patronage.
There were relics of ancient institutions: the principality of Wales,
the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, and the earldom of Chester;
each with its revenue and establishment of superfluous officials. The
royal household was a complex 'body corporate' founded in the old days
of 'purveyance.' There was the mysterious 'Board of Green Cloth'
formed by the great officers and supposed to have judicial as well as
administrative functions. Cumbrous medi&aelig;val machinery thus remained
which had been formed in the time when the distinction between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
a
public trust and private property was not definitely drawn or which
had been allowed to remain for the sake of patronage, when its
functions had been transferred to officials of more modern type.
Reform was foiled, as Burke put it, because the turnspit in the king's
kitchen was a member of parliament. Such sinecures and the pensions on
the civil list or the Irish establishment provided the funds by which
the king could build up a personal influence, which was yet occult,
irresponsible, and corrupt. The measure passed by Burke in 1782<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
made a beginning in the removal of such abuses.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Whigs were conveniently blind to another side of the
question. If the king could buy, it was because there were plenty of
people both able and willing to sell. Bubb Dodington, a typical
example of the old system, had five or six seats at his disposal:
subject only to the necessity of throwing a few pounds to the 'venal
wretches' who went through the form of voting, and by dealing in what
he calls this 'merchantable ware' he managed by lifelong efforts to
wriggle into a peerage. The Dodingtons, that is, sold because they
bought. The 'venal wretches' were the lucky franchise-holders in
rotten boroughs. The 'Friends of the People'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in 1793 made the
often-repeated statement that 154 individuals returned 307 members,
that is, a majority of the house. In Cornwall, again, 21 boroughs with
453 electors controlled by about 15 individuals returned 42
members,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> or, with the two county members, only one member less than
Scotland; and the Scottish members were elected by close corporations
in boroughs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and by the great families in counties. No wonder if the
House of Commons seemed at times to be little more than an exchange
for the traffic between the proprietors of votes and the proprietors
of offices and pensions.</p>

<p>The demand for the reforms advocated by Burke and Dunning was due to
the catastrophe of the American War. The scandal caused by the famous
coalition of 1783 showed that a diminution of the royal influence
might only make room for selfish bargains among the proprietors of
parliamentary influence. The demand for reform was taken up by Pitt.
His plan was significant. He proposed to disfranchise a few rotten
boroughs; but to soften this measure he afterwards suggested that a
million should be set aside to buy such boroughs as should voluntarily
apply for disfranchisement. The seats obtained were to be mainly added
to county representation; but the franchise was to be extended so as
to add about 99,000 voters in boroughs, and additional seats were to
be given to London and Westminster and to Manchester, Leeds,
Birmingham, and Sheffield. The Yorkshire reformers, who led the
movement, were satisfied with this modest scheme. The borough
proprietors were obviously too strong to be directly attacked, though
they might be induced to sell some of their power.</p>

<p>Here was a mass of anomalies, sufficient to supply topics of
denunciation for two generations of reformers, and, in time, to excite
fears of violent revolution. Without undertaking the easy task of
denouncing exploded systems, we may ask what state of mind they
implied. Our ancestors were perfectly convinced that their political
system was of almost unrivalled excellence: they held that they were
freemen entitled to look down upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
foreigners as the slaves of
despots. Nor can we say that their satisfaction was without solid
grounds. The boasting about English freedom implied some
misunderstanding. But it was at least the boast of a vigorous race.
Not only were there individuals capable of patriotism and public
spirit, but the body politic was capable of continuous energy. During
the eighteenth century the British empire spread round the world.
Under Chatham it had been finally decided that the English race should
be the dominant element in the new world; if the political connection
had been severed by the bungling of his successors, the unbroken
spirit of the nation had still been shown in the struggle against
France, Spain, and the revolted colonies; and whatever may be thought
of the motives which produced the great revolutionary wars, no one can
deny the qualities of indomitable self-reliance and high courage to
the men who led the country through the twenty years of struggle
against France, and for a time against France with the continent at
its feet. If moralists or political theorists find much to condemn in
the ends to which British policy was directed, they must admit that
the qualities displayed were not such as can belong to a simply
corrupt and mean-spirited government.</p>

<p>One obvious remark is that, on the whole, the system was a very good
one&mdash;as systems go. It allowed free play to the effective political
forces. Down to the revolutionary period, the nation as a whole was
contented with its institutions. The political machinery provided a
sufficient channel for the really efficient force of public opinion.
There was as yet no large class which at once had political
aspirations and was unable to gain a hearing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
England was still in
the main an agricultural country: and the agricultural labourer was
fairly prosperous till the end of the century, while his ignorance and
isolation made him indifferent to politics. There might be a bad
squire or parson, as there might be a bad season; but squire and
parson were as much parts of the natural order of things as the
weather. The farmer or yeoman was not much less stolid; and his
politics meant at most a choice between allegiance to one or other of
the county families. If in the towns which were rapidly developing
there was growing up a discontented population, its discontent was not
yet directed into political channels. An extended franchise meant a
larger expenditure on beer, not the readier acceptance of popular
aspirations. To possess a vote was to have a claim to an occasional
bonus rather than a right to influence legislation. Practically,
therefore, parliament might be taken to represent what might be called
'public opinion,' for anything that deserved to be called public
opinion was limited to the opinions of the gentry and the more
intelligent part of the middle classes. There was no want of
complaints of corruption, proposals to exclude placemen from
parliament and the like; and in the days of Wilkes, Chatham, and
Junius, when the first symptoms of democratic activity began to affect
the political movement, the discontent made itself audible and
alarming. But a main characteristic of the English reformers was the
constant appeal to precedent, even in their most excited moods. They
do not mention the rights of man; they invoke the 'revolution
principles' of 1688; they insist upon the 'Bill of Rights' or Magna
Charta. When keenly roused they recall the fate of Charles <small>I.</small>; and
their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
favourite toast is the cause for which Hampden died on the
field and Sidney on the scaffold. They believe in the jury as the
'palladium of our liberties'; and are convinced that the British
Constitution represents an unsurpassable though unfortunately an ideal
order of things, which must have existed at some indefinite period.
Chatham in one of his most famous speeches, appeals, for example, to
the 'iron barons' who resisted King John, and contrasts them with the
silken courtiers which now compete for place and pensions. The
political reformers of the time, like religious reformers in most
times, conceive of themselves only as demanding the restoration of the
system to its original purity, not as demanding its abrogation. In
other words, they propose to remedy abuses but do not as yet even
contemplate a really revolutionary change. Wilkes was not a 'Wilkite,'
nor was any of his party, if Wilkite meant anything like Jacobin.</p>

<p class="scs">II. <a name="I_II" id="I_II"></a>THE RULING CLASS</p>

<p>Thus, however anomalous the constitution of parliament, there was no
thought of any far-reaching revolution. The great mass of the
population was too ignorant, too scattered and too poor to have any
real political opinions. So long as certain prejudices were not
aroused, it was content to leave the management of the state to the
dominant class, which alone was intelligent enough to take an interest
in public affairs and strong enough to make its interest felt. This
class consisted in the first place of the great landed interest. When
Lord North opposed Pitt's reform in 1785 he said<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that the
Constitution
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
was 'the work of infinite wisdom ... the most beautiful
fabric that had ever existed since the beginning of time.' He added
that 'the bulk and weight' of the house ought to be in 'the hands of
the country-gentlemen, the best and most respectable objects of the
confidence of the people,' The speech, though intended to please an
audience of country-gentlemen, represented a genuine belief.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The
country-gentlemen formed the class to which not only the
constitutional laws but the prevailing sentiment of the country gave
the lead in politics as in the whole social system. Even reformers
proposed to improve the House of Commons chiefly by increasing the
number of county-members, and a county-member was almost necessarily a
country-gentleman of an exalted kind. Although the country-gentleman
was very far from having all things his own way, his ideals and
prejudices were in a great degree the mould to which the other
politically important class conformed. There was indeed a growing
jealousy between the landholders and the 'monied-men.' Bolingbroke had
expressed this distrust at an earlier part of the century. But the
true representative of the period was his successful rival, Walpole, a
thorough country-gentleman who had learned to understand the mysteries
of finance and acquired the confidence of the city. The great
merchants of London and the rising manufacturers in the country were
rapidly growing in wealth and influence. The monied-men represented
the most active, energetic, and growing part of the body politic.
Their interests determined the direction of the national policy. The
great wars of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
century were undertaken in the interests of British
trade. The extension of the empire in India was carried on through a
great commercial company. The growth of commerce supported the
sea-power which was the main factor in the development of the empire.
The new industrial organisation which was arising was in later years
to represent a class distinctly opposed to the old aristocratic order.
At present it was in a comparatively subordinate position. The squire
was interested in the land and the church; the merchant thought more
of commerce and was apt to be a dissenter. But the merchant, in spite
of some little jealousies, admitted the claims of the
country-gentleman to be his social superior and political leader. His
highest ambition was to be himself admitted to the class or to secure
the admission of his family. As he became rich he bought a solid
mansion at Clapham or Wimbledon, and, if he made a fortune, might
become lord of manors in the country. He could not as yet aspire to
become himself a peer, but he might be the ancestor of peers. The son
of Josiah Child, the great merchant of the seventeenth century, became
Earl Tylney, and built at Wanstead one of the noblest mansions in
England. His contemporary Sir Francis Child, Lord Mayor, and a founder
of the Bank of England, built Osterley House, and was ancestor of the
earls of Jersey and Westmoreland. The daughter of Sir John Barnard,
the typical merchant of Walpole's time, married the second Lord
Palmerston. Beckford, the famous Lord Mayor of Chatham's day, was
father of the author of <i>Vathek</i>, who married an earl's daughter and
became the father of a duchess. The Barings, descendants of a German
pastor, settled in England early in the century
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and became
country-gentlemen, baronets, and peers. Cobbett, who saw them rise,
reviled the stockjobbers who were buying out the old families. But the
process had begun long before his days, and meant that the heads of
the new industrial system were being absorbed into the class of
territorial magnates. That class represented the framework upon which
both political and social power was moulded.</p>

<p>This implies an essential characteristic of the time. A familiar topic
of the admirers of the British Constitution was the absence of the
sharp lines of demarcation between classes and of the exclusive
aristocratic privileges which, in France, provoked the revolution. In
England the ruling class was not a 'survival': it had not retained
privileges without discharging corresponding functions. The essence of
'self-government,' says its most learned commentator,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is the
organic connection 'between State and society.' On the Continent, that
is, powers were intrusted to a centralised administrative and judicial
hierarchy, which in England were left to the class independently
strong by its social position. The landholder was powerful as a
product of the whole system of industrial and agricultural
development; and he was bound in return to perform arduous and
complicated duties. How far he performed them well is another
question. At least, he did whatever was done in the way of governing,
and therefore did not sink into a mere excrescence or superfluity. I
must try to point out certain results which had a material effect upon
English opinion in general and, in particular, upon the Utilitarians.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
The country-gentlemen formed the bulk of the law-making body, and the
laws gave the first point of assault of the Utilitarian movement. One
explanation is suggested by a phrase attributed to Sir Josiah
Child.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The laws, he said, were a heap of nonsense, compiled by a
few ignorant country-gentlemen, who hardly knew how to make good laws
for the government of their own families, much less for the regulation
of companies and foreign commerce. He meant that the parliamentary
legislation of the century was the work of amateurs, not of
specialists; of an assembly of men more interested in immediate
questions of policy or personal intrigue than in general principles,
and not of such a centralised body as would set a value upon symmetry
and scientific precision. The country-gentleman had strong prejudices
and enough common sense to recognise his own ignorance. The product of
a traditional order, he clung to traditions, and regarded the old
maxims as sacred because no obvious reason could be assigned for them.
He was suspicious of abstract theories, and it did not even occur to
him that any such process as codification or radical alteration of the
laws was conceivable. For the law itself he had the profound
veneration which is expressed by Blackstone. It represented the
'wisdom of our ancestors'; the system of first principles, on which
the whole order of things reposed, and which must be regarded as an
embodiment of right reason. The common law was a tradition, not made
by express legislation, but somehow existing apart from any definite
embodiment, and revealed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
to certain learned hierophants. Any changes,
required by the growth of new social conditions, had to be made under
pretence of applying the old rules supposed to be already in
existence. Thus grew up the system of 'judge-made law,' which was to
become a special object of the denunciations of Bentham. Child had
noticed the incompetence of the country-gentlemen to understand the
regulation of commercial affairs. The gap was being filled up, without
express legislation, by judicial interpretations of Mansfield and his
fellows. This, indeed, marks a characteristic of the whole system.
'Our constitution,' says Professor Dicey,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> 'is a judge-made
constitution, and it bears on its face all the features, good and bad,
of judge-made law.' The law of landed property, meanwhile, was of
vital and immediate interest to the country-gentleman. But, feeling
his own incompetence, he had called in the aid of the expert. The law
had been developed in medi&aelig;val times, and bore in all its details the
marks of the long series of struggles between king and nobles and
parliaments. One result had been the elaborate series of legal
fictions worked out in the conflict between private interests and
public policy, by which lawyers had been able to adapt the rules
fitted for an ancient state of society to another in which the very
fundamental conceptions were altered. A mysterious system had thus
grown up, which deterred any but the most resolute students. Of
Fearne's essay upon 'Contingent remainders'(published in 1772) it was
said that no work 'in any branch of science could afford a more
beautiful instance of analysis.' Fearne had shown the acuteness of 'a
Newton or a Pascal.' Other critics dispute this proposition; but in
any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
case the law was so perplexing that it could only be fully
understood by one who united antiquarian knowledge to the subtlety of
a great logician. The 'vast and intricate machine,' as Blackstone
calls it, 'of a voluminous family settlement' required for its
explanation the dialectical skill of an accomplished schoolman. The
poor country-gentleman could not understand the terms on which he held
his own estate without calling in an expert equal to such a task. The
man who has acquired skill so essential to his employer's interests is
not likely to undervalue it or to be over anxious to simplify the
labyrinth in which he shone as a competent guide.</p>

<p>The lawyers who played so important a part by their familiarity with
the mysteries of commercial law and landed property, naturally enjoyed
the respect of their clients, and were rewarded by adoption into the
class. The English barrister aspired to success by himself taking part
in politics and legislation. The only path to the highest positions
really open to a man of ability, not connected by blood with the great
families, was the path which led to the woolsack or to the judge's
bench. A great merchant might be the father or father-in-law of peers;
a successful soldier or sailor might himself become a peer, but
generally he began life as a member of the ruling classes, and his
promotion was affected by parliamentary influence. But a successful
lawyer might fight his way from a humble position to the House of
Lords. Thurlow, son of a country-gentleman; Dunning, son of a country
attorney; Ellenborough, son of a bishop and descendant of a long line
of North-country 'statesmen'; Kenyon, son of a farmer; Eldon, son of a
Newcastle coal merchant, represent the average career of a successful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
barrister. Some of them rose to be men of political importance, and
Thurlow and Eldon had the advantage of keeping George <small>III</small>'s
conscience&mdash;an unruly faculty which had an unfortunately strong
influence upon affairs. The leaders of the legal profession,
therefore, and those who hoped to be leaders, shared the prejudices,
took a part in the struggles, and were rewarded by the honours of the
dominant class.</p>

<p>The criminal law became a main topic of reformers. There, as
elsewhere, we have a striking example of traditional modes of thought
surviving with singular persistence. The rough classification of
crimes into felony and misdemeanour, and the strange technical rules
about 'benefit of clergy' dating back to the struggles of Henry <small>II.</small>
and Becket, remained like ultimate categories of thought. When the
growth of social conditions led to new temptations or the appearance
of a new criminal class, and particular varieties of crime became
conspicuous, the only remedy was to declare that some offence should
be 'felony without benefit of clergy,' and therefore punishable by
death. By unsystematic and spasmodic legislation the criminal law
became so savage as to shock every man of common humanity. It was
tempered by the growth of technical rules, which gave many chances of
escape to the criminal; and by practical revolt against its excesses,
which led to the remission of the great majority of capital
sentences.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The legislators were clumsy, not intentionally cruel;
and the laws, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
sanguinary in reality, were more sanguinary in
theory than in practice. Nothing, on the other hand, is more
conspicuous than the spirit of fair play to the criminal, which struck
foreign observers.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It was deeply rooted in the whole system. The
English judge was not an official agent of an inquisitorial system,
but an impartial arbitrator between the prisoner and the prosecutor.
In political cases especially a marked change was brought about by the
revolution of 1688. If our ancestors talked some nonsense about trial
by jury, the system certainly insured that the persons accused of
libel or sedition should have a fair trial, and very often something
more. Judges of the Jeffreys type had become inconceivable, though
impartiality might disappear in cases where the prejudices of juries
were actively aroused. Englishmen might fairly boast of their immunity
from the arbitrary methods of continental rulers; and their
unhesitating confidence in the fairness of the system became so
ingrained as to be taken as a matter of course, and scarcely received
due credit from later critics of the system.</p>

<p>The country-gentleman, again, was not only the legislator but a most
important figure in the judicial and administrative system. As justice
of the peace, he was the representative of law and order to his
country neighbours. The preface of 1785 to the fifteenth edition of
Burn's <i>Justice of the Peace</i>, published originally in 1755,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
mentions
that in the interval between these dates, some three hundred statutes
had been passed affecting the duties of justices, while half as many
had been repealed or modified. The justice was of course, as a rule, a
superficial lawyer, and had to be prompted by his clerk, the two
representing on a small scale the general relation between the lawyers
and the ruling class. Burn tells the justice for his comfort that the
judges will take a lenient view of any errors into which his ignorance
may have led him. The discharge of such duties by an independent
gentleman was thought to be so desirable and so creditable to him that
his want of efficiency must be regarded with consideration. Nor,
though the justices have been a favourite butt for satirists, does it
appear that the system worked badly. When it became necessary to
appoint paid magistrates in London, and the pay, according to the
prevalent system, was provided by fees, the new officials became known
as 'trading justices,' and their salaries, as Fielding tells us, were
some of the 'dirtiest money upon earth.' The justices might perhaps be
hard upon a poacher (as, indeed, the game laws became one of the great
scandals of the system), or liable to be misled by a shrewd attorney;
but they were on the whole regarded as the natural and creditable
representatives of legal authority in the country.</p>

<p>The justices, again, discharged functions which would elsewhere belong
to an administrative hierarchy, Gneist observes that the power of the
justices of the peace represents the centre of gravity of the whole
administrative system.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Their duties had become so multifarious
and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
perplexed that Burn could only arrange them under alphabetical
heads. Gneist works out a systematic account, filling many pages of
elaborate detail, and showing how large a part they played in the
whole social structure. An intense jealousy of central power was one
correlative characteristic. Blackstone remarks in his more liberal
humour that the number of new offices held at pleasure had greatly
extended the influence of the crown. This refers to the custom-house
officers, excise officers, stamp distributors and postmasters. But if
the tax-gatherer represented the state, he represented also part of
the patronage at the disposal of politicians. A voter was often in
search of the place of a 'tidewaiter'; and, as we know, the greatest
poet of the day could only be rewarded by making him an exciseman. Any
extension of a system which multiplied public offices was regarded
with suspicion. Walpole, the strongest minister of the century, had
been forced to an ignominious retreat when he proposed to extend the
excise. The cry arose that he meant to enslave the country and extend
the influence of the crown over all the corporations in England. The
country-gentleman had little reason to fear that government would
diminish his importance by tampering with his functions. The justices
of the peace were called upon to take a great and increasing share in
the administration of the poor-law. They were concerned in all manner
of financial details; they regulated such police as existed; they
looked after the old laws by which the trades were still restricted;
and, in theory at least,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
could fix the rate of wages. Parliament did
not override, but only gave the necessary sanction to their activity.
If we looked through the journals of the House of Commons during the
American War, for example, we should get the impression that the whole
business of the legislature was to arrange administrative details. If
a waste was to be enclosed, a canal or a highroad to be constructed,
there was no public department to be consulted. The gentry of the
neighbourhood joined to obtain a private act of parliament which gave
the necessary powers to the persons interested. No general enclosure
act could be passed, though often suggested. It would imply a central
commission, which would only, as was suggested, give rise to jobbery
and take power out of the natural hands. Parliament was omnipotent; it
could regulate the affairs of the empire or of a parish; alter the
most essential laws or act as a court of justice; settle the crown or
arrange for a divorce or for the alteration of a private estate. But
it objected to delegate authority even to a subordinate body, which
might tend to become independent. Thus, if it was the central power
and source of all legal authority, it might also be regarded as a kind
of federal league, representing the wills of a number of partially
independent persons. The gentry could meet there and obtain the
sanction of their allies for any measure required in their own little
sphere of influence. But they had an instinctive aversion to the
formation of any organised body representing the state. The
neighbourhood which wanted a road got powers to make it, and would
concur in giving powers to others. But if the state were to be
intrusted to make roads, ministers would have more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
places to give,
and roads might be made which they did not want. The English roads had
long been infamous, but neither was money wasted, as in France, on
roads where there was no traffic.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Thus we have the combination of
an absolute centralisation of legislative power with an utter absence
of administrative centralisation. The units meeting in parliament
formed a supreme assembly; but they did not sink their own
individuality. They only met to distribute the various functions among
themselves.</p>

<p>The English parish with its squire, its parson, its lawyer and its
labouring population was a miniature of the British Constitution in
general. The squire's eldest son could succeed to his position; a
second son might become a general or an admiral; a third would take
the family living; a fourth, perhaps, seek his fortune at the bar.
This implies a conception of other political conditions which
curiously illustrate some contemporary conceptions.</p>

<p class="scs">IV. <a name="I_IV" id="I_IV"></a>THE ARMY AND NAVY</p>

<p>We are often amused by the persistency of the cry against a 'standing
army' in England. It did not fairly die out until the revolutionary
wars. Blackstone regards it as a singularly fortunate circumstance
'that any branch of the legislature might annually put an end to the
legal existence of the army by refusing to concur in the continuance'
of the mutiny act. A standing army was obviously necessary; but by
making believe very hard,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
we could shut our eyes to the facts, and
pretend that it was a merely temporary arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The doctrine
had once had a very intelligible meaning. If James <small>II.</small> had possessed a
disciplined army of the continental pattern, with Marlborough at its
head, Marlborough would hardly have been converted by the prince of
Orange. But loyal as the gentry had been at the restoration, they had
taken very good care that the Stuarts should not have in their hand
such a weapon as had been possessed by Cromwell. When the Puritan army
was disbanded, they had proceeded to regulate the militia. The
officers were appointed by the lords-lieutenants of counties, and had
to possess a property qualification; the men raised by ballot in their
own districts; and their numbers and length of training regulated by
Act of Parliament. The old 'train-bands' were suppressed, except in
the city of London, and thus the recognised military force of the
country was a body essentially dependent upon the country gentry. The
militia was regarded with favour as the 'old constitutional force'
which could not be used to threaten our liberties. It was remodelled
during the Seven Years' War and embodied during that and all our later
wars. It was, however, ineffective by its very nature. An aristocracy
which chose to carry on wars must have a professional army in fact,
however careful it might be to pretend that it was a provision for a
passing necessity. The pretence had serious consequences. Since the
army was not to have interests separate from the people, there was no
reason for building barracks. The men might be billeted on publicans,
or placed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
under canvas, while they were wanted. When the great war
came upon us, large sums had to be spent to make up for the previous
neglect. Fox, on 22nd February 1793, protested during a lively debate
upon this subject that sound constitutional principles condemned
barracks, because to mix the army with the people was the 'best
security against the danger of a standing army.'<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In fact a large part of the army was a mere temporary force. In 1762,
towards the end of the Seven Years' War, we had about 100,000 men in
pay; and after the peace, the force was reduced to under 20,000.
Similar changes took place in every war. The ruling class took
advantage of the position. An army might be hired from Germany for the
occasion. New regiments were generally raised by some great man who
gave commissions to his own relations and dependants. When the
Pretender was in Scotland, for example, fifteen regiments were raised
by patriotic nobles, who gave the commissions, and stipulated that
although they were to be employed only in suppressing the rising, the
officers should have permanent rank.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> So, as was shown in Mrs.
Clarke's case, a patent for raising a regiment might be a source of
profit to the undertaker, who again might get it by bribing the
mistress of a royal duke. The officers had, according to the generally
prevalent system, a modified property in their commissions; and the
system of sale was not abolished till our own days. We may therefore
say that the ruling class, on the one hand, objected to a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
standing
army, and, on the other, since such an army was a necessity, farmed it
from the country and were admitted to have a certain degree of private
property in the concern. The prejudice against any permanent
establishment made it necessary to fill the ranks on occasion by all
manner of questionable expedients. Bounties were offered to attract
the vagrants who hung loose upon society. Smugglers, poachers, and the
like were allowed to choose between military service and
transportation. The general effect was to provide an army of
blackguards commanded by gentlemen. The army no doubt had its merits
as well as its defects. The continental armies which it met were
collected by equally demoralising methods until the French revolution
led to a systematic conscription. The bad side is suggested by
Napier's famous phrase, the 'cold shade of our aristocracy'; while
Napier gives facts enough to prove both the brutality too often shown
by the private soldier and the dogged courage which is taken to be
characteristic even of the English blackguard. By others,&mdash;by such men
as the duke of Wellington and Lord Palmerston, for example, types of
the true aristocrat&mdash;the system was defended<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> as bringing men of
good family into the army and so providing it, as the duke thought,
with the best set of officers in Europe. No doubt they and the royal
dukes who commanded them were apt to be grossly ignorant of their
business; but it may be admitted by a historian that they often showed
the qualities of which Wellington was himself a type. The English
officer was a gentleman before he was a soldier, and considered the
military virtues to be a part of his natural endowment. But it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
was
undoubtedly a part of his traditional code of honour to do his duty
manfully and to do it rather as a manifestation of his own spirit than
from any desire for rewards or decorations. The same quality is
represented more strikingly by the navy. The English admiral
represents the most attractive and stirring type of heroism in our
history. Nelson and the 'band of brothers' who served with him, the
simple and high-minded sailors who summed up the whole duty of man in
doing their best to crush the enemies of their country, are among the
finest examples of single-souled devotion to the calls of patriotism.
The navy, indeed, had its ugly side no less than the army. There was
corruption at Greenwich<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and in the dockyards, and parliamentary
intrigue was a road to professional success. Voltaire notes the queer
contrast between the English boast of personal liberty and the
practice of filling up the crews by pressgangs. The discipline was
often barbarous, and the wrongs of the common sailor found sufficient
expression in the mutiny at the Nore. A grievance, however, which
pressed upon a single class was maintained from the necessity of the
case and the inertness of the administrative system. The navy did not
excite the same jealousy as the army; and the officers were more
professionally skilful than their brethren. The national qualities
come out, often in their highest form, in the race of great seamen
upon whom the security of the island power essentially depended.</p>

<p class="scs">V. <a name="I_V" id="I_V"></a>THE CHURCH</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
I turn, however, to the profession which was more directly connected
with the intellectual development of the country. The nature of the
church establishment gives the most obvious illustration of the
connection between the intellectual position on the one hand and the
social and political order on the other, though I do not presume to
decide how far either should be regarded as effect and the other as
cause.</p>

<p>What is the church of England? Some people apparently believe that it
is a body possessing and transmitting certain supernatural powers.
This view was in abeyance for the time for excellent reasons, and,
true or false, is no answer to the constitutional question. It does
not enable us to define what was the actual body with which lawyers
and politicians have to deal. The best answer to such questions in
ordinary case would be given by describing the organisation of the
body concerned. We could then say what is the authority which speaks
in its name; and what is the legislature which makes its laws, alters
its arrangements, and defines the terms of membership. The supreme
legislature of the church of England might appear to be parliament. It
is the Act of Uniformity which defines the profession of belief
exacted from the clergy; and no alteration could be made in regard to
the rights and duties of the clergy except by parliamentary authority.
The church might therefore be regarded as simply the religious
department of the state. Since 1688, however, the theory and the
practice of toleration had introduced difficulties. Nonconformity was
not by itself punishable though it exposed a man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
to certain
disqualifications. The state, therefore, recognised that many of its
members might legally belong to other churches, although it had, as
Warburton argued, formed an 'alliance' with the dominant church. The
spirit of toleration was spreading throughout the century. The old
penal laws, due to the struggles of the seventeenth century, were
becoming obsolete in practice and were gradually being repealed. The
Gordon riots of 1780 showed that a fanatical spirit might still be
aroused in a mob which wanted an excuse for plunder; but the laws were
not explicitly defended by reasonable persons and were being gradually
removed by legislation towards the end of the century. Although,
therefore, parliament was kept free from papists, it could hardly
regard church and state as identical, or consider itself as entitled
to act as the representative body of the church. No other body,
indeed, could change the laws of the church; but parliament recognised
its own incompetence to deal with them. Towards the end of the
century, various attempts were made to relax the terms of
subscription. It was proposed, for example, to substitute a profession
of belief in the Bible for a subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles.
But the House of Commons sensibly refused to expose itself by
venturing upon any theological innovations. A body more ludicrously
incompetent could hardly have been invented.</p>

<p>Hence we must say that the church had either no supreme body which
could speak in its name and modify its creed, its ritual, its
discipline, or the details of its organisation; or else, that the only
body which had in theory a right to interfere was doomed, by
sufficient considerations, to absolute inaction. The church, from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
a
secular point of view, was not so much a department of the state as an
aggregate of offices, the functions of which were prescribed by
unalterable tradition. It consisted of a number of bishops, deans and
chapters, rectors, vicars, curates, and so forth, many of whom had
certain proprietary rights in their position, and who were bound by
law to discharge certain functions. But the church, considered as a
whole, could hardly be called an organism at all, or, if an organism,
it was an organism with its central organ in a permanent state of
paralysis. The church, again, in this state was essentially dependent
upon the ruling classes. A glance at the position of the clergy shows
their professional position. At their head were the bishops, some of
them enjoying princely revenues, while others were so poor as to
require that their incomes should be eked out by deaneries or livings
held <i>in commendam</i>. The great sees, such as Canterbury, Durham, Ely,
and Winchester, were valued at between, &pound;20,000 and &pound;30,000 a year;
while the smaller, Llandaff, Bangor, Bristol, and Gloucester, were
worth less than &pound;2000. The bishops had patronage which enabled them to
provide for relatives or for deserving clergymen. The average incomes
of the parochial clergy, meanwhile, were small. In 1809 they were
calculated to be worth &pound;255, while nearly four thousand livings were
worth under &pound;150; and there were four or five thousand curates with
very small pay. The profession, therefore, offered a great many blanks
with a few enormous prizes. How were those prizes generally obtained?
When the reformers published the <i>Black Book</i> in 1820, they gave a
list of the bishops holding sees in the last year of George <small>III.</small>; and,
as most of these gentlemen were on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
their promotion at the end of the
previous century. I give the list in a note.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>There were twenty-seven bishoprics including Sodor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and Man. Of these
eleven were held by members of noble families; fourteen were held by
men who had been tutors in, or in other ways personally connected with
the royal family or the families of ministers and great men; and of
the remaining two, one rested his claim upon political writing in
defence of Pitt, while the other seems to have had the support of a
great city company. The system of translation enabled the government
to keep a hand upon the bishops. Their elevation to the more valuable
places or leave to hold subsidiary preferments depended upon their
votes in the House of Lords. So far, then, as secular motives
operated, the tendency of the system was clear. If Providence had
assigned to you a duke for a father or an uncle, preferment would fall
to you as of right. A man of rank who takes orders should be rewarded
for his condescension. If that qualification be not secured, you
should aim at being tutor in a great family, accompany a lad on the
grand tour, or write some pamphlet on a great man's behalf. Paley
gained credit for independence at Cambridge, and spoke with contempt
of the practice of 'rooting,' the cant phrase for patronage hunting.
The text which he facetiously suggested for a sermon when Pitt visited
Cambridge, 'There is a young man here who has six loaves and two
fishes, but what are they among so many?' hit off the spirit in which
a minister was regarded at the universities. The memoirs of Bishop
Watson illustrate the same sentiment. He lived in his pleasant country
house at Windermere, never visiting his diocese, and according to De
Quincey, talking Socinianism at his table. He felt himself to be a
deeply injured man, because ministers had never found an opportunity
for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
translating him to a richer diocese, although he had written
against Paine and Gibbon. If they would not reward their friends, he
argued, why should he take up their cause by defending Christianity?</p>

<p>The bishops were eminently respectable. They did not lead immoral
lives, and if they gave a large share of preferment to their families,
that at least was a domestic virtue. Some of them, Bishop Barrington
of Durham, for example, took a lead in philanthropic movements; and,
if considered simply as prosperous country-gentlemen, little fault
could be found with them. While, however, every commonplace motive
pointed so directly towards a career of subserviency to the ruling
class among the laity, it could not be expected that they should take
a lofty view of their profession. The Anglican clergy were not like
the Irish priesthood, in close sympathy with the peasantry, or like
the Scottish ministers, the organs of strong convictions spreading
through the great mass of the middle and lower classes. A man of
energy, who took his faith seriously, was, like the Evangelical
clergy, out of the road to preferment, or, like Wesley, might find no
room within the church at all. His colleagues called him an
'enthusiast,' and disliked him as a busybody if not a fanatic. They
were by birth and adoption themselves members of the ruling class;
many of them were the younger sons of squires, and held their livings
in virtue of their birth. Advowsons are the last offices to retain a
proprietary character. The church of that day owed such a
representative as Horne Tooke to the system which enabled his father
to provide for him by buying a living. From the highest to the lowest
ranks of clergy, the church was as Matthew Arnold could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
still call
it, an 'appendage of the barbarians.' The clergy, that is, as a whole,
were an integral but a subsidiary part of the aristocracy or the great
landed interest. Their admirers urged that the system planted a
cultivated gentleman in every parish in the country. Their opponents
replied, like John Sterling, that he was a 'black dragoon with horse
meat and man's meat'&mdash;part of the garrison distributed through the
country to support the cause of property and order. In any case the
instinctive prepossessions, the tastes and favourite pursuits of the
profession were essentially those of the class with which it was so
intimately connected. Arthur Young,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> speaking of the French clergy,
observes that at least they are not poachers and foxhunters, who
divide their time between hunting, drinking, and preaching. You do not
in France find such advertisements as he had heard of in England,
'Wanted a curacy in a good sporting country, where the duty is light
and the neighbourhood convivial.' The proper exercise for a country
clergyman, he rather quaintly observes, is agriculture. The ideal
parson, that is, should be a squire in canonical dress. The clergy of
the eighteenth century probably varied between the extremes
represented by Trulliber and the Vicar of Wakefield. Many of them were
excellent people, with a mild taste for literature, contributing to
the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, investigating the antiquities of their
county, occasionally confuting a deist, exerting a sound judgment in
cultivating their glebes or improving the breed of cattle, and
respected both by squire and farmers. The 'Squarson,' in Sydney
Smith's facetious phrase, was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
ideal clergyman. The purely
sacerdotal qualities, good or bad, were at a minimum. Crabbe, himself
a type of the class, has left admirable portraits of his fellows.
Profound veneration for his noble patrons and hearty dislike for
intrusive dissenters were combined in his own case with a pure
domestic life, a keen insight into the uglier realities of country
life and a good sound working morality. Miss Austen, who said that she
could have been Crabbe's wife, has given more delicate pictures of the
clergyman as he appeared at the tea-tables of the time. He varies
according to her from the squire's excellent younger brother, who is
simply a squire in a white neck-cloth, to the silly but still
respectable sycophant, who firmly believes his lady patroness to be a
kind of local deity. Many of the real memoirs of the day give pleasant
examples of the quiet and amiable lives of the less ambitious clergy.
There is the charming Gilbert White (1720-1793) placidly studying the
ways of tortoises, and unconsciously composing a book which breathes
an undying charm from its atmosphere of peaceful repose; William
Gilpin (1724-1804) founding and endowing parish schools, teaching the
catechism, and describing his vacation tours in narratives which
helped to spread a love of natural scenery; and Thomas Gisborne
(1758-1846), squire and clergyman, a famous preacher among the
evangelicals and a poet after the fashion of Cowper, who loved his
native Needwood Forest as White loved Selborne and Gilpin loved the
woods of Boldre; and Cowper himself (1731-1800) who, though not a
clergyman, lived in a clerical atmosphere, and whose gentle and
playful enjoyment of quiet country life relieves the painfully deep
pathos of his disordered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
imagination; and the excellent W. L. Bowles
(1762-1850), whose sonnets first woke Coleridge's imagination, who
spent eighty-eight years in an amiable and blameless life, and was
country-gentleman, magistrate, antiquary, clergyman, and poet.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Such names are enough to recall a type which has not quite vanished,
and which has gathered a new charm in more stirring and fretful times.
These most excellent people, however, were not likely to be prominent
in movements destined to break up the placid environment of their
lives nor, in truth, to be sources of any great intellectual stir.</p>

secretary to the duke of Portland; and Bowyer Edward Sparke, bishop of
Ely, had been tutor to the duke of Rutland. The two remaining bishops
were Herbert Marsh, bishop of Peterborough, who had established a
claim by defending Pitt's financial measures in an important pamphlet;
and William Van Mildert, bishop of Llandaff, who had been chaplain to
the Grocers' Company and became known as a preacher in London.</p></div>

<p class="scs">VI. <a name="I_VI" id="I_VI"></a>THE UNIVERSITIES</p>

<p>The effect of these conditions is perhaps best marked in the state of
the universities. Universities have at different periods been great
centres of intellectual life. The English universities of the
eighteenth century are generally noted only as embodiments of sloth
and prejudice. The judgments of Wesley and Gibbon and Adam Smith and
Bentham coincide in regard to Oxford; and Johnson's love of his
university is an equivocal testimony to its intellectual merits. We
generally think of it as of a sleepy hollow, in which portly fellows
of colleges, like the convivial Warton, imbibed port wine and sneered
at Methodists, though few indeed rivalled Warton's services to
literature. The universities in fact had become, as they long
continued to be, high schools chiefly for the use of the clergy, and
if they still aimed at some wider intellectual training, were sinking
to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
institutions where the pupils of the public schools might, if
they pleased, put a little extra polish upon their classical and
mathematical knowledge. The colleges preserved their medi&aelig;val
constitution; and no serious changes of their statutes were made until
the middle of the present century. The clergy had an almost exclusive
part in the management, and dissenters were excluded even from
entering Oxford as students.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> But the clergyman did not as a rule
devote himself to a life of study. He could not marry as a fellow, but
he made no vows of celibacy. The college, therefore, was merely a
stepping-stone on the way to the usual course of preferment. A fellow
looked forwards to settling in a college living, or if he had the luck
to act as tutor to a nobleman, he might soar to a deanery or a
bishopric. The fellows who stayed in their colleges were probably
those who had least ambition, or who had a taste for an easy
bachelor's life. The universities, therefore, did not form bodies of
learned men interested in intellectual pursuits; but at most, helped
such men in their start upon a more prosperous career. The studies
flagged in sympathy. Gray's letters sufficiently reveal the dulness
which was felt by a man of cultivation confined within the narrow
society of college dons of the day. The scholastic philosophy which
had once found enthusiastic cultivators in the great universities had
more or less held its own through the seventeenth century, though
repudiated by all the rising thinkers. Since the days of Locke and
Berkeley, it had fallen utterly out of credit. The bright common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
sense of the polished society of the day looked upon the old doctrine
with a contempt, which, if not justified by familiarity, was an
implicit judgment of the tree by its fruits. Nobody could suppose the
divines of the day to be the depositaries of an esoteric wisdom which
the vulgar were not worthy to criticise. They were themselves chiefly
anxious to prove that their sacred mysteries were really not at all
mysterious, but merely one way of expressing plain common sense. At
Oxford, indeed, the lads were still crammed with Aldrich, and learned
the technical terms of a philosophy which had ceased to have any real
life in it. At Cambridge, ardent young radicals spoke with contempt of
this 'horrid jargon&mdash;fit only to be chattered by monkies in a
wilderness.'<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Even at Cambridge, they still had disputations on the
old form, but they argued theses from Locke's essay, and thought that
their mathematical studies were a check upon metaphysical 'jargon.' It
is indeed characteristic of the respect for tradition that at
Cambridge even mathematics long suffered from a mistaken patriotism
which resented any improvement upon the methods of Newton. There were
some signs of reviving activity. The fellowships were being
distributed with less regard to private interest. The mathematical
tripos founded at Cambridge in the middle of the century became the
prototype of all competitive examinations; and half a century later
Oxford followed the precedent by the Examination Statute of 1800. A
certain number of professorships of such modern studies as anatomy,
history, botany, and geology were founded during the eighteenth
century, and show a certain sense of a need of broader views. The
lectures
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
upon which Blackstone founded his commentaries were the
product of the foundation of the Vinerian professorship in 1751; and
the most recent of the Cambridge colleges, Downing College, shows by
its constitution that a professoriate was now considered to be
desirable. Cambridge in the last years of the century might have had a
body of very eminent professors. Watson, second wrangler of 1759, had
delivered lectures upon chemistry, of which it was said by Davy that
hardly any conceivable change in the science could make them
obsolete.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Paley, senior wrangler in 1763, was an almost unrivalled
master of lucid exposition, and one of his works is still a textbook
at Cambridge. Isaac Milner, senior wrangler in 1774, afterwards held
the professorships of mathematics and natural philosophy, and was
famous as a sort of ecclesiastical Dr. Johnson. Gilbert Wakefield,
second wrangler in 1776, published an edition of Lucretius, and was a
man of great ability and energy. Herbert Marsh, second wrangler in
1779, was divinity professor from 1807, and was the first English
writer to introduce some knowledge of the early stages of German
criticism. Porson, the greatest Greek scholar of his time, became
professor in 1790; Malthus, ninth wrangler in 1788, who was to make a
permanent mark upon political economy, became fellow of Jesus College
in 1793. Waring, senior wrangler in 1757, Vince, senior wrangler in
1775, and Wollaston, senior wrangler in 1783, were also professors and
mathematicians of reputation. Towards the end of the century ten
professors were lecturing.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> A large number were not lecturing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
though Milner was good enough to be 'accessible to students.' Paley
and Watson had been led off into the path of ecclesiastical
preferment. Marsh too became a bishop in 1816. There was no place for
such talents as those of Malthus, who ultimately became professor at
Haileybury. Wakefield had the misfortune of not being able to cover
his heterodoxy with the conventional formula. Porson suffered from the
same cause, and from less respectable weaknesses; but it seems that
the university had no demand for services of the great scholar, and he
did nothing for his &pound;40 a year. Milner was occupied in managing the
university in the interests of Pitt and Protestantism, and in waging
war against Jacobins and intruders. There was no lack of ability; but
there was no inducement to any intellectual activity for its own sake;
and there were abundant temptations for any man of energy to diverge
to the career which offered more intelligible rewards.</p>

<p>The universities in fact supplied the demand which was actually
operative. They provided the average clergyman with a degree; they
expected the son of the country-gentleman or successful lawyer to
acquire the traditional culture of his class, and to spend three or
four years pleasantly, or even, if he chose, industriously. But there
was no such thing as a learned society, interested in the cultivation
of knowledge for its own sake, and applauding the devotion of life to
its extension or discussion. The men of the time who contributed to
the progress of science owed little or nothing to the universities,
and were rather volunteers from without, impelled by their own
idiosyncrasies. Among the scientific leaders, for example, Joseph
Black (1728-1799) was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Scottish professor; Priestley (1733-1804) a
dissenting minister; Cavendish (1731-1810) an aristocratic recluse,
who, though he studied at Cambridge, never graduated; Watt (1736-1819)
a practical mechanician; and Dalton (1766-1844) a Quaker schoolmaster.
John Hunter (1728-1793) was one of the energetic Scots who forced
their way to fame without help from English universities. The
cultivation of the natural sciences was only beginning to take root;
and the soil, which it found congenial, was not that of the great
learned institutions, which held to their old traditional studies.</p>

<p>I may, then, sum up the result in a few words. The church had once
claimed to be an entirely independent body, possessing a supernatural
authority, with an organisation sanctioned by supernatural powers, and
entitled to lay down the doctrines which gave the final theory of
life. Theology was the queen of the sciences and theologians the
interpreters of the first principles of all knowledge and conduct. The
church of England, on the other hand, at our period had entirely
ceased to be independent: it was bound hand and foot by acts of
parliament: there was no ecclesiastical organ capable of speaking in
its name, altering its laws or defining its tenets: it was an
aggregate of offices the appointment to which was in the hands either
of the political ministers or of the lay members of the ruling class.
It was in reality simply a part of the ruling class told off to
perform divine services: to maintain order and respectability and the
traditional morality. It had no distinctive philosophy or theology,
for the articles of belief represented simply a compromise; an attempt
to retain as much of the old as was practicable and yet to admit as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
much of the new as was made desirable by political considerations. It
was the boast of its more liberal members that they were not tied down
to any definite dogmatic system; but could have a free hand so long as
they did not wantonly come into conflict with some of the legal
formul&aelig; laid down in a previous generation. The actual teaching showed
the effects of the system. It had been easy to introduce a
considerable leaven of the rationalism which suited the lay mind; to
explain away the mysterious doctrines upon which an independent church
had insisted as manifestations of its spiritual privileges, but which
were regarded with indifference or contempt by the educated laity now
become independent. The priest had been disarmed and had to suit his
teaching to the taste of his patrons and congregations. The divines of
the eighteenth century had, as they boasted, confuted the deists; but
it was mainly by showing that they could be deists in all but the
name. The dissenters, less hampered by legal formul&aelig;, had drifted
towards Unitarianism. The position of such divines as Paley, Watson,
and Hey was not so much that the Unitarians were wrong, as that the
mysterious doctrines were mere sets of words, over which it was
superfluous to quarrel. The doctrine was essentially traditional; for
it was impossible to represent the doctrines of the church of England
as deductions from any abstract philosophy. But the traditions were
not regarded as having any mysterious authority. Abstract philosophy
might lead to deism or infidelity. Paley and his like rejected such
philosophy in the spirit of Locke or even Hume. But it was always
possible to treat a tradition like any other statement of fact. It
could be proved by appropriate evidence. The truth of Christianity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
was therefore merely a question of facts like the truth of any other
passages of history. It was easy enough to make out a case for the
Christian miracles, and then the mysteries, after it had been
sufficiently explained that they really meant next to nothing, could
be rested upon the authority of the miracles. In other words, the
accepted doctrines, like the whole constitution of the church, could
be so modified as to suit the prejudices and modes of thought of the
laity. The church, it may be said, was thoroughly secularised. The
priest was no longer a wielder of threats and an interpreter of
oracles, but an entirely respectable gentleman, who fully sympathised
with the prejudices of his patron and practically admitted that he had
very little to reveal, beyond explaining that his dogmas were
perfectly harmless and eminently convenient. He preached, however, a
sound common sense morality, and was not divided from his neighbours
by setting up the claims characteristic of a sacerdotal caste. Whether
he has become on the whole better or worse by subsequent changes is a
question not to be asked here; but perhaps not quite so easily
answered as is sometimes supposed.</p>

<p>The condition of the English church and universities may be contrasted
with that of their Scottish rivals. The Scottish church and
universities had no great prizes to offer and no elaborate hierarchy.
But the church was a national institution in a sense different from
the English. The General Assembly was a powerful body, not
overshadowed by a great political rival. To rise to be a minister was
the great ambition of poor sons of farmers and tradesmen. They had to
study at the universities in the intervals, perhaps, of agricultural
labour; and if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the learning was slight and the scholarship below the
English standard, the young aspirant had at least to learn to preach
and to acquire such philosophy as would enable him to argue upon grace
and freewill with some hard-headed Davie Deans. It was doubtless owing
in part to these conditions that the Scottish universities produced
many distinguished teachers throughout the century. Professors had to
teach something which might at least pass for philosophy, though they
were more or less restrained by the necessity of respecting orthodox
prejudices. At the end of the century, the only schools of philosophy
in the island were to be found in Scotland, where Reid (1710-1796) and
Adam Smith (1723-1790) had found intelligent disciples, and where
Dugald Stewart, of whom I shall speak presently, had become the
recognised philosophical authority.</p>

<p class="scs">VII. <a name="I_VII" id="I_VII"></a>THEORY</p>

<p>What theory corresponds to this practical order? It implies, in the
first place, a constant reference to tradition. The system has grown
up without any reference to abstract principles or symmetrical plan.
The legal order supposes a traditional common law, as the
ecclesiastical order a traditional creed, and the organisation is
explicable only by historical causes. The system represents a series
of compromises, not the elaboration of a theory. If the squire
undertook by way of supererogation to justify his position he appealed
to tradition and experience. He invoked the 'wisdom of our ancestors,'
the system of 'checks and balances' which made our Constitution an
unrivalled mixture of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
deserving
the 'dread and envy of the world.' The prescription for compounding
that mixture could obviously be learned by nothing but experiment.
Traditional means empirical. By instinct, rather than conscious
reasoning, Englishmen had felt their way to establishing the 'palladia
of our liberties': trial by jury, the 'Habeas Corpus' Act, and the
substitution of a militia for a standing army. The institutions were
cherished because they had been developed by long struggles and were
often cherished when their real justification had disappeared. The
Constitution had not been 'made' but had 'grown'; or, in other words,
the one rule had been the rule of thumb. That is an excellent rule in
its way, and very superior to an abstract rule which neglects or
overrides experience. The 'logic of facts,' moreover, may be trusted
to produce a certain harmony: and general principles, though not
consciously invoked, tacitly govern the development of institutions
worked out under uniform conditions. The simple reluctance to pay
money without getting money's worth might generate the important
principle that representation should go with taxation, without
embodying any theory of a 'social contract' such as was offered by an
afterthought to give a philosophical sanction. Englishmen, it is said,
had bought their liberties step by step, because at each step they
were in a position to bargain with their rulers. What they had bought
they were determined to keep and considered to be their inalienable
property. One result is conspicuous. In England the ruling classes did
not so much consider their privileges to be something granted by the
state, as the power of the state to be something derived from their
concessions. Though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the lord-lieutenant and the justices of the peace
were nominated by the crown, their authority came in fact as an almost
spontaneous consequence of their birthright or their acquired position
in the country. They shone by their own light and were really the
ultimate sources of authority. Seats in parliament, preferments in the
church, commissions in the army belonged to them like their estates;
and they seemed to be qualified by nature, rather than by appointment,
to act in judicial and administrative capacities. The system of
'self-government' embodies this view. The functions of government were
assigned to men already powerful by their social position. The absence
of the centralised hierarchy of officials gave to Englishmen the sense
of personal liberty which compelled the admiration of Voltaire and his
countrymen in the eighteenth century. In England were no <i>lettres de
cachet</i>, and no Bastille. A man could say what he thought and act
without fear of arbitrary rule. There was no such system as that
which, in France, puts the agents of the central power above the
ordinary law of the land. This implies what has been called the 'rule
of the law' in England. 'With us every official from the prime
minister down to a constable or a collector of taxes' (as Professor
Dicey explains the principle) 'is under the same responsibility for
every act done without legal justification as any other citizen.'<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
The early centralisation of the English monarchy had made the law
supreme, and instead of generating a new structure had combined and
regulated the existing social forces. The sovereign power was thus
farmed to the aristocracy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
instead of forming an organ of its own.
Instead of resigning power they were forced to exercise it on
condition of thorough responsibility to the central judiciary. Their
privileges were not destroyed but were combined with the discharge of
corresponding duties. Whatever their shortcomings, they were preserved
from the decay which is the inevitable consequence of a divorce of
duties from privileges.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the case is equally clear. If the privilege is
associated with a duty, the duty may also be regarded as a privilege.
The doctrine seems to mark a natural stage in the evolution of the
conception of duty to the state. The power which is left to a member
of the ruling class is also part of his dignity. Thus we have an
amalgamation between the conceptions of private property and public
trust. 'In so far as the ideal of feudalism is perfectly realised,' it
has been said,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> 'all that we can call public law is merged in
private law; jurisdiction is property; office is property; the
kingship itself is property.' This feudal ideal was still preserved
with many of the institutions descended from feudalism. The king's
right to his throne was regarded as of the same kind as the right to a
private estate. His rights as king were also his rights as the owner
of the land.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Subordinate landowners had similar rights, and as the
royal power diminished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
greater powers fell to the aggregate of
constitutional kinglets who governed the country. Each of them was
from one point of view an official, but each also regarded his office
as part of his property. The country belonged to him and his class
rather than he to the country. We occasionally find the quaint theory
which deduced political rights from property in land. The freeholders
were the owners of the soil and might give notice to quit to the rest
of the population.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> They had therefore a natural right to carry on
government in their own interests. The ruling classes, however, were
not marked off from others by any deep line of demarcation; they could
sell their own share in the government to anybody who was rich enough
to buy it, and there was a constant influx of new blood. Moreover,
they did in fact improve their estate with very great energy, and
discharged roughly, but in many ways efficiently, the duties which
were also part of their property. The nobleman or even the squire was
more than an individual; as head of a family he was a life tenant of
estates which he desired to transmit to his descendants. He was a
'corporation sole' and had some of the spirit of a corporation. A
college or a hospital is founded to discharge a particular function;
its members continue perhaps to recognise their duty; but they resent
any interference from outside as sacrilege or confiscation. It is for
them alone to judge how they can best carry out, and whether they are
actually carrying out, the aims of the corporate life. In the same way
the great noble took his part in legislation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
church preferment, the
command of the army, and so forth, and fully admitted that he was
bound in honour to play his part effectively; but he was equally
convinced that he was subject to nothing outside of his sense of
honour. His duties were also his rights. The na&iuml;f expression of this
doctrine by a great borough proprietor, 'May I not do what I like with
my own?' was to become proverbial.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>This, finally, suggests that a doctrine of 'individualism' is implied
throughout. The individual rights are the antecedent and the rights of
the state a consequent or corollary. Every man has certain sacred
rights accruing to him in virtue of 'prescription' or tradition,
through his inherited position in the social organism. The 'rule of
law' secures that he shall exercise them without infringing the
privileges of his neighbour. He may moreover be compelled by the law
to discharge them on due occasion. But, as there is no supreme body
which can sufficiently superintend, stimulate, promote, or dismiss,
the active impulse must come chiefly from his own sense of the fitness
of things. The efficiency therefore depends upon his being in such a
position that his duty may coincide with his personal interest. The
political machinery can only work efficiently on the assumption of a
spontaneous activity of the ruling classes, prompted by public spirit
or a sense of personal dignity. Meanwhile, 'individualism' in a
different sense was represented by the forces which made for progress
rather than order, and to them I must now turn.

<h3>THE INDUSTRIAL SPIRIT</h3>

<p class="scs">I. <a name="II_I" id="II_I"></a>THE MANUFACTURERS</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
The history of England during the eighteenth century shows a curious
contrast between the political stagnancy and the great industrial
activity. The great constitutional questions seemed to be settled; and
the statesmen, occupied mainly in sharing power and place, took a very
shortsighted view (not for the first time in history) of the great
problems that were beginning to present themselves. The British empire
in the East was not won by a towering ambition so much as forced upon
a reluctant commercial company by the necessities of its position. The
English race became dominant in America; but the political connection
was broken off mainly because English statesmen could only regard it
from the shopkeeping point of view. When a new world began to arise at
the Antipodes, our rulers saw an opportunity not for planting new
offshoots of European civilisation, but for ridding themselves of the
social rubbish no longer accepted in America. With purblind energy,
and eyes doggedly fixed upon the ground at their feet, the race had
somehow pressed forwards to illustrate the old doctrine that a man
never goes so far as when he does
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
not know whither he is going. While
thinking of earning an honest penny by extending the trade, our
'monied-men' were laying the foundation of vast structures to be
developed by their descendants.</p>

<p>Politicians, again, had little to do with the great 'industrial
revolution' which marked the last half of the century. The main facts
are now a familiar topic of economic historians; nor need I speak of
them in detail. Though agriculture was still the main industry, and
the landowners almost monopolised political power, an ever growing
proportion of the people was being collected in towns; the artisans
were congregating in large factories; and the great cloud of
coal-smoke, which has never dwindled, was already beginning to darken
our skies. The change corresponds to the difference between a fully
developed organism possessed of a central brain, with an elaborate
nervous system, and some lower form in which the vital processes are
still carried on by a number of separate ganglia. The concentration of
the population in the great industrial centres implied the improvement
of the means of commerce; new organisation of industry provided with a
corresponding apparatus of machinery; and the systematic exploitation
of the stored-up forces of nature. Each set of changes was at once
cause and effect, and each was carried on separately, although in
relation to the other. Brindley, Arkwright, and Watt may be taken as
typical representatives of the three operations. Canals,
spinning-jennies, and steam-engines were changing the whole social
order.</p>

<p>The development of means of communication had been slow till the last
half of the century. The roads had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
been little changed since they had
been first laid down as part of the great network which bound the
Roman empire together. Turnpike acts, sanctioning the construction of
new roads, became numerous. Palmer's application of the stage-coaches
to the carriage of the mails marked an epoch in 1784; and De Quincey's
prose poem, 'The Mail-coach,' shows how the unprecedented speed of
Palmer's coaches, then spreading the news of the first battles in the
Peninsula, had caused them to tyrannise over the opium-eater's dreams.
They were discharging at once a political and an industrial function.
Meanwhile the Bridgewater canal, constructed between 1759 and 1761,
was the first link in a great network which, by the time of the French
revolution, connected the seaports and the great centres of industry.
The great inventions of machinery were simultaneously enabling
manufacturers to take advantage of the new means of communication. The
cotton manufacture sprang up soon after 1780 with enormous rapidity.
Aided by the application of steam (first applied to a cotton mill in
1785) it passed the woollen trade, the traditional favourite of
legislators, and became the most important branch of British trade.
The iron trade had made a corresponding start. While the steam-engine,
on which Watt had made the first great improvement in 1765, was
transforming the manufacturing system, and preparing the advent of the
steamship and railroad, Great Britain had become the leading
manufacturing and commercial country in the world. The agricultural
interest was losing its pre-eminence; and huge towns with vast
aggregations of artisan population were beginning to spring up with
unprecedented rapidity. The change
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
was an illustration upon a
gigantic scale of the doctrines expounded in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>.
Division of labour was being applied to things more important than
pin-making, involving a redistribution of functions not as between men
covered by the same roof, but between whole classes of society;
between the makers of new means of communication and the manufacturers
of every kind of material. The whole industrial community might be
regarded as one great organism. Yet the organisation was formed by a
multitude of independent agencies without any concerted plan. It was
thus a vast illustration of the doctrine that each man by pursuing his
own interests promoted the interests of the whole, and that government
interference was simply a hindrance. The progress of improvement, says
Adam Smith, depends upon 'the uniform, constant, and uninterrupted
effort of every man to better his condition,' which often succeeds in
spite of the errors of government, as nature often overcomes the
blunders of doctors. It is, as he infers, 'the highest impertinence
and presumption for kings and ministers to pretend to watch over the
economy of private people' by sumptuary laws and taxes upon
imports.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> To the English manufacturer or engineer government
appeared as a necessary evil. It allowed the engineer to make roads
and canals, after a troublesome and expensive process of application.
It granted patents to the manufacturer, but the patents were a source
of perpetual worry and litigation. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
might look with complacency upon the development of a new branch of
trade; but it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
was because he was lying in wait to come down upon it
with a new tax or system of duties.</p>

<p>The men who were the chief instruments of the process were
'self-made'; they were the typical examples of Mr. Smiles's virtue of
self-help; they owed nothing to government or to the universities
which passed for the organs of national culture. The leading engineers
began as ordinary mechanics. John Metcalf (1717-1810), otherwise
'blind Jack of Knaresborough,' was a son of poor parents. He had lost
his sight by smallpox at the age of six, and, in spite of his
misfortune, became a daring rider, wrestler, soldier, and carrier, and
made many roads in the north of England, executing surveys and
constructing the works himself. James Brindley (1716-1772), son of a
midland collier, barely able to read or write, working out plans by
processes which he could not explain, and lying in bed till they took
shape in his brain, a rough mechanic, labouring for trifling weekly
wages, created the canals which mainly enabled Manchester and
Liverpool to make an unprecedented leap in prosperity. The two great
engineers, Thomas Telford (1757-1834), famous for the Caledonian canal
and the Menai bridge; and John Rennie (1761-1821), drainer of
Lincolnshire fens, and builder of Waterloo bridge and the Plymouth
breakwater, rose from the ranks. Telford inherited and displayed in a
different direction the energies of Eskdale borderers, whose
achievements in the days of cattle-stealing were to be made famous by
Scott: Rennie was the son of an East Lothian farmer. Both of them
learned their trade by actual employment as mechanics. The inventors
of machinery belonged mainly to the lower middle classes. Kay was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> a
small manufacturer; Hargreaves a hand-loom weaver; Crompton the son of
a small farmer; and Arkwright a country barber. Watt, son of a
Greenock carpenter, came from the sturdy Scottish stock, ultimately of
covenanting ancestry, from which so many eminent men have sprung.</p>

<p>The new social class, in which such men were the leaders, held
corresponding principles. They owed whatever success they won to their
own right hands. They were sturdy workers, with eyes fixed upon
success in life, and success generally of course measured by a money
criterion. Many of them showed intellectual tastes, and took an
honourable view of their social functions. Watt showed his ability in
scientific inquiries outside of the purely industrial application;
Josiah Wedgwood, in whose early days the Staffordshire potters had led
a kind of gipsy life, settling down here and there to carry on their
trade, had not only founded a great industry, but was a man of
artistic taste, a patron of art, and a lover of science. Telford, the
Eskdale shepherd, was a man of literary taste, and was especially
friendly with the typical man of letters, Southey. Others, of course,
were of a lower type. Arkwright combined the talents of an inventor
with those of a man of business. He was a man, says Baines (the
historian of the cotton trade), who was sure to come out of an
enterprise with profit, whatever the result to his partners. He made a
great fortune, and founded a county family. Others rose in the same
direction. The Peels, for example, represented a line of yeomen. One
Peel founded a cotton business; his son became a baronet and an
influential member of parliament; and his grandson went to Oxford, and
became the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
great leader of the Conservative party, although like
Walpole, he owed his power to a kind of knowledge in which his adopted
class were generally deficient.</p>

<p>The class which owed its growing importance to the achievements of
such men was naturally imbued with their spirit. Its growth meant the
development of a class which under the old order had been strictly
subordinate to the ruling class, and naturally regarded it with a
mingled feeling of respect and jealousy. The British merchant felt his
superiority in business to the average country-gentleman; he got no
direct share of the pensions and sinecures which so profoundly
affected the working of the political machinery, and yet his highest
ambition was to rise to be himself a member of the class, and to found
a family which might flourish in the upper atmosphere. The industrial
classes were inclined to favour political progress within limits. They
were dissenters because the church was essentially part of the
aristocracy; and they were readiest to denounce the abuses from which
they did not profit. The agitators who supported Wilkes, solid
aldermen and rich merchants, represented the view which was popular in
London and other great cities. They were the backbone of the Whig
party when it began to demand a serious reform. Their radicalism,
however, was not thoroughly democratic. Many of them aspired to become
members of the ruling class, and a shopkeeper does not quarrel too
thoroughly with his customers. The politics of individuals were of
course determined by accidents. Some of them might retain the sympathy
of the class from which they sprang, and others might adopt an even
extreme version of the opinions of the class to which they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
desired to
rise. But, in any case, the divergence of interest between the
capitalists and the labourers was already making itself felt. The
self-made man, it is said, is generally the hardest master. He
approves of the stringent system of competition, of which he is
himself a product. It clearly enables the best man to win, for is he
not himself the best man? The class which was the great seat of
movement had naturally to meet all the prejudices which are roused by
change. The farmers near London, as Adam Smith tells us,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
petitioned against an extension of turnpike roads, which would enable
more distant farmers to compete in their market. But the farmers were
not the only prejudiced persons. All the great inventors of machinery,
Kay and Arkwright and Watt, had constantly to struggle against the old
workmen who were displaced by their inventions. Although, therefore,
the class might be Whiggish, it did not share the strongest
revolutionary passions. The genuine revolutionists were rather the men
who destroyed the manufacturer's machines, and were learning to regard
him as a natural enemy. The manufacturer had his own reasons for
supporting government. Our foreign policy during the century was in
the long run chiefly determined by the interests of our trade, however
much the trade might at times be hampered by ill-conceived
regulations. It is remarkable that Adam Smith<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> argues that,
although the capitalist is acuter that the country-gentleman, his
acuteness is chiefly displayed by knowing his own interests better.
Those interests, he thinks, do not coincide so much as the interests
of the country-gentleman with the general interests of the country.
Consequently the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
country-gentleman, though less intelligent, is more
likely to favour a national and liberal policy. The merchant, in fact,
was not a free-trader because he had read Adam Smith or consciously
adopted Smith's principles, but because or in so far as particular
restrictions interfered with him. Arthur Young complains bitterly of
the manufacturers who supported the prohibition to export English
wool, and so protected their own class at the expense of
agriculturists. Wedgwood, though a good liberal and a supporter of
Pitt's French treaty in 1786, joined in protesting against the
proposal for free-trade with Ireland. The Irish, he thought, might
rival his potteries. Thus, though as a matter of fact the growing
class of manufacturers and merchants were inclined in the main to
liberal principles, it was less from adhesion to any general doctrine
than from the fact that the existing restrictions and prejudices
generally conflicted with their plain interests.</p>

<p>Another characteristic is remarkable. Though the growth of
manufactures and commerce meant the growth of great towns, it did not
mean the growth of municipal institutions. On the contrary, as I shall
presently have to notice, the municipalities were sinking to their
lowest ebb. Manufactures, in the first instance, spread along the
streams into country districts: and to the great manufacturer, working
for his own hand, his neighbours were competitors as much as allies.
The great towns, however, which were growing up, showed the general
tendencies of the class. They were centres not only of manufacturing
but of intellectual progress. The population of Birmingham, containing
the famous Soho works of Boulton and Watt, had increased between 1740
and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
1780 from 24,000 to 74,000 inhabitants. Watt's partner Boulton
started the 'Lunar Society' at Birmingham.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Its most prominent
member was Erasmus Darwin, famous then for poetry which is chiefly
remembered by the parody in the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>; and now more famous as
the advocate of a theory of evolution eclipsed by the teaching of his
more famous grandson, and, in any case, a man of remarkable
intellectual power. Among those who joined in the proceedings was
Edgeworth, who in 1768 was speculating upon moving carriages by steam,
and Thomas Day, whose <i>Sandford and Merton</i> helped to spread in
England the educational theories of Rousseau. Priestley, who settled
at Birmingham in 1780, became a member, and was helped in his
investigations by Watt's counsels and Wedgwood's pecuniary help. Among
occasional visitors were Smeaton, Sir Joseph Banks, Solander, and
Herschel of scientific celebrity; while the literary magnate, Dr.
Parr, who lived between Warwick and Birmingham, occasionally joined
the circle. Wedgwood, though too far off to be a member, was intimate
with Darwin and associated in various enterprises with Boulton.
Wedgwood's congenial partner, Thomas Bentley (1731-1780), had been in
business at Manchester and at Liverpool. He had taken part in founding
the Warrington 'Academy,' the dissenting seminary (afterwards moved to
Manchester) of which Priestley was tutor (1761-1767), and had lectured
upon art at the academy founded at Liverpool in 1773. Another member
of the academy was William Roscoe (1753-1831), whose literary taste
was shown by his lives of Lorenzo de Medici and Leo <small>X.</small>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> and who
distinguished himself by opposing the slave-trade, then the infamy of
his native town. Allied with him in this movement were William
Rathbone and James Currie (1756-1805) the biographer of Burns, a
friend of Darwin and an intelligent physician. At Manchester Thomas
Perceval (1740-1804) founded the 'Literary and Philosophical Society'
in 1780. He was a pupil of the Warrington Academy, which he afterwards
joined on removing to Manchester, and he formed the scheme afterwards
realised by Owens College. He was an early advocate of sanitary
measures and factory legislation, and a man of scientific reputation.
Other members of the society were: John Ferriar (1761-1815), best
known by his <i>Illustrations of Sterne</i>, but also a man of literary and
scientific reputation; the great chemist, John Dalton (1766-1844), who
contributed many papers to its transactions; and, for a short time,
the Socialist Robert Owen, then a rising manufacturer. At Norwich,
then important as a manufacturing centre, was a similar circle.
William Taylor, an eminent Unitarian divine, who died at the
Warrington Academy in 1761, had lived at Norwich. One of his daughters
married David Martineau and became the mother of Harriet Martineau,
who has described the Norwich of her early years. John Taylor,
grandson of William, was father of Mrs. Austin, wife of the jurist. He
was a man of literary tastes, and his wife was known as the Madame
Roland of Norwich. Mrs. Opie (1765-1853) was daughter of James
Alderson, a physician of Norwich, and passed most of her life there.
William Taylor (1761-1836), another Norwich manufacturer, was among
the earliest English students of German literature. Norwich had
afterwards the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
unique distinction of being the home of a provincial
school of artists. John Crome (1788-1821), son of a poor weaver, and
John Sell Cotman (1782-1842) were its leaders; they formed a kind of
provincial academy, and exhibited pictures which have been more
appreciated since their death. At Bristol, towards the end of the
century, were similar indications of intellectual activity. Coleridge
and Southey found there a society ready to listen to their early
lectures, and both admired Thomas Beddoes (1760-1808), a physician, a
chemist, a student of German, an imitator of Darwin in poetry, and an
assailant of Pitt in pamphlets. He had married one of Edgeworth's
daughters. With the help and advice of Wedgwood and Watt, he founded
the 'Pneumatic Institute' at Clifton in 1798, and obtained the help of
Humphry Davy, who there made some of his first discoveries. Davy was
soon transported to the Royal Institution, founded at the suggestion
of Count Rumford in 1799, which represented the growth of a popular
interest in the scientific discoveries.</p>

<p>The general tone of these little societies represents, of course, the
tendency of the upper stratum of the industrial classes. In their own
eyes they naturally represented the progressive element of society.
They were Whigs&mdash;for 'radicalism' was not yet invented&mdash;but Whigs of
the left wing; accepting the aristocratic precedency, but looking
askance at the aristocratic prejudices. They were rationalists, too,
in principle, but again within limits: openly avowing the doctrines
which in the Established church had still to be sheltered by
ostensible conformity to the traditional dogmas. Many of them
professed the Unitarianism to which the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
dissenting bodies
inclined. 'Unitarianism,' said shrewd old Erasmus Darwin, 'is a
feather-bed for a dying Christian.' But at present such men as
Priestley and Price were only so far on the road to a thorough
rationalism as to denounce the corruptions of Christianity, as they
denounced abuses in politics, without anticipating a revolutionary
change in church and state. Priestley, for example, combined
'materialism' and 'determinism' with Christianity and a belief in
miracles, and controverted Horsley upon one side and Paine on the
other.</p>

<p class="scs">II. <a name="II_II" id="II_II"></a>THE AGRICULTURISTS</p>

<p>The general spirit represented by such movements was by no means
confined to the commercial or manufacturing classes; and its most
characteristic embodiment is to be found in the writings of a leading
agriculturist.</p>

<p>Arthur Young,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> born in 1741, was the son of a clergyman, who had
also a small ancestral property at Bradfield, near Bury St. Edmunds.
Accidents led to his becoming a farmer at an early age. He showed more
zeal than discretion, and after trying three thousand experiments on
his farm, he was glad to pay &pound;100 to another tenant to take his farm
off his hands. This experience as a practical agriculturist, far from
discouraging him, qualified him in his own opinion to speak with
authority,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and he became a devoted missionary of the gospel of
agricultural improvement. The enthusiasm with which he admired more
successful labourers in the cause, and the indignation with which he
regards the sluggish and retrograde, are charming. His kindliness, his
keen interest in the prosperity of all men, rich or poor, his ardent
belief in progress, combined with his quickness of observation, give a
charm to the writings which embody his experience. Tours in England
and a temporary land-agency in Ireland supplied him with materials for
books which made him known both in England and on the Continent. In
1779 he returned to Bradfield, where he soon afterwards came into
possession of his paternal estate, which became his permanent home. In
1784 he tried to extend his propaganda by bringing out the <i>Annals of
Agriculture</i>&mdash;a monthly publication, of which forty-five half-yearly
volumes appeared. He had many able contributors and himself wrote many
interesting articles, but the pecuniary results were mainly negative.
In 1791 his circulation was only 350 copies.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Meanwhile his
acquaintance with the duc de Liancourt led to tours in France from
1788 to 1790. His <i>Travels in France</i>, first published in 1792, has
become a classic. In 1793 Young was made secretary to the Board of
Agriculture, of which I shall speak presently. He became known in
London society as well as in agricultural circles. He was a handsome
and attractive man, a charming companion, and widely recognised as an
agricultural authority. The empress of Russia sent him a snuff-box;
'Farmer George' presented a merino ram; he was elected member of
learned societies; he visited
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Burke at Beaconsfield, Pitt at
Holmwood, and was a friend of Wilberforce and of Jeremy Bentham.</p>

<p>Young had many domestic troubles. His marriage was not congenial; the
loss of a tenderly loved daughter in 1797 permanently saddened him; he
became blind, and in his later years sought comfort in religious
meditation and in preaching to his poorer neighbours. He died 20th
April 1820. He left behind him a gigantic history of agriculture,
filling ten folio volumes of manuscript, which, though reduced to six
by an enthusiastic disciple after his death, have never found their
way to publication.</p>

<p>The <i>Travels in France</i>, Young's best book, owes one merit to the
advice of a judicious friend, who remarked that the previous tours had
suffered from the absence of the personal details which interest the
common reader. The insertion of these makes Young's account of his
French tours one of the most charming as well as most instructive
books of the kind. It gives the vivid impression made upon a keen and
kindly observer in all their freshness. He sensibly retained the
expressions of opinion made at the time. 'I may remark at present,' he
says,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> 'that although I was totally mistaken in my prediction, yet,
on a revision, I think I was right in it.' It was right, he means,
upon the data then known to him, and he leaves the unfulfilled
prediction as it was. The book is frequently cited in justification of
the revolution, and it may be fairly urged that his authority is of
the more weight, because he does not start from any sympathy with
revolutionary principles. Young was in Paris when the oath was taken
at the tennis-court; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
makes his reflections upon the beauty of the
British Constitution, and the folly of visionary reforms, in a spirit
which might have satisfied Burke. He was therefore not altogether
inconsistent when, after the outrages, he condemned the revolution,
however much the facts which he describes may tend to explain the
inevitableness of the catastrophe. At any rate, his views are worth
notice by the indications which they give of the mental attitude of a
typical English observer.</p>

<p>Young in his vivacious way struck out some of the phrases which became
proverbial with later economists. 'Give a man the secure possession of
a bleak rock and he will turn it into a garden. Give him a nine years'
lease of a garden, and he will convert it into a desert.'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> 'The
magic of <small>PROPERTY</small> turns sand to gold.'<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> He is delighted with the
comfort of the small proprietors near Pau, which reminds him of
English districts still inhabited by small yeomen.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Passing to a
less fortunate region, he explains that the prince de Soubise has a
vast property there. The property of a grand 'seigneur' is sure to be
a desert.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The signs which indicate such properties are 'wastes,
<i>landes</i>, deserts, fern, ling.' The neighbourhood of the great
residences is well peopled&mdash;'with deer, wild boars, and wolves,' 'Oh,'
he exclaims, 'if I was the legislator of France for a day, I would
make such great lords skip again!' 'Why,' he asked, 'were the people
miserable in lower Savoy?' '<i>Because</i>', was the reply, '<i>there are
seigneurs everywhere</i>'.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Misery in Brittany was due 'to the
execrable maxims of despotism
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
or the equally detestable prejudices of
a feudal nobility.'<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> There was nothing, he said, in the province
but 'privileges and poverty,'<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> privileges of the nobles and poverty
of the peasants.</p>

<p>Young was profoundly convinced, moreover, that, as he says more than
once<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> 'everything in this world depends on government.' He is
astonished at the stupidity and ignorance of the provincial
population, and ascribes it to the lethargy produced by despotism.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
He contrasts it with 'the energetic and rapid circulation of wealth,
animation, and intelligence of England,' where 'blacksmiths and
carpenters' would discuss every political event. And yet he heartily
admires some of the results of a centralised monarchy. He compares the
miserable roads in Catalonia on the Spanish side of the frontier with
the magnificent causeways and bridges on the French side. The
difference is due to the 'one all-powerful cause that instigates
mankind ... government.'<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> He admires the noble public works, the
canal of Languedoc, the harbours at Cherbourg and Havre, and the
<i>&eacute;cole v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire</i> where agriculture is taught upon scientific
principles. He is struck by the curious contrast between France and
England. In France the splendid roads are used by few travellers, and
the inns are filthy pothouses; in England there are detestable roads,
but a comparatively enormous traffic. When he wished to make the great
nobles 'skip' he does not generally mean confiscation. He sees indeed
one place where in 1790 the poor had seized a piece of waste land,
declaring that the poor were the nation, and that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
waste belonged
to the nation. He declares<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> that he considers their action 'wise,
rational, and philosophical,' and wishes that there were a law to make
such conduct legal in England. But his more general desire is that the
landowners should be compelled to do their duty. He complains that the
nobles live in 'wretched holes' in the country in order to save the
means of expenditure upon theatres, entertainments, and gambling in
the towns.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> 'Banishment alone will force the French nobility to do
what the English do for pleasure&mdash;to reside upon and adorn their
estates.'<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> He explains to a French friend that English agriculture
has flourished 'in spite of the teeth of our ministers'; we have had
many Colberts, but not one Sully<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>; and we should have done much
better, he thinks, had agriculture received the same attention as
commerce. This is the reverse of Adam Smith's remark upon the superior
liberality of the English country-gentleman, who did not, like the
manufacturers, invoke protection and interference. In truth, Young
desired both advantages, the vigour of a centralised government and
the energy of an independent aristocracy. His absence of any general
theory enables him to do justice in detail at the cost of consistency
in general theory. In France, as he saw, the nobility had become in
the main an encumbrance, a mere dead weight upon the energies of the
agriculturist. But he did not infer that large properties in land were
bad in themselves; for in England he saw that the landowners were the
really energetic and improving class. He naturally looked at the
problem from the point of view of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
intelligent land-agent. He is
full of benevolent wishes for the labourer, and sympathises with the
attempt to stimulate their industry and improve their dwellings, and
denounces oppression whether in France or Ireland with the heartiest
goodwill. But it is characteristic of the position that such a man&mdash;an
enthusiastic advocate of industrial progress&mdash;was a hearty admirer of
the English landowner. He sets out upon his first tour, announcing
that he does not write for farmers, of whom not one in five thousand
reads anything, but for the country-gentlemen, who are the great
improvers. Tull, who introduced turnips; Weston, who introduced
clover; Lord Townshend and Allen, who introduced 'marling' in Norfolk,
were all country-gentlemen, and it is from them that he expects
improvement. He travels everywhere, delighting in their new houses and
parks, their picture galleries, and their gardens laid out by Kent or
'Capability Brown'; he admires scenery, climbs Skiddaw, and is
rapturous over views of the Alps and Pyrenees; but he is thrown into a
rage by the sight of wastes, wherever improvement is possible. What
delights him is an estate with a fine country-house of Palladian
architecture ('Gothic' is with him still a term of abuse),<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> with
grounds well laid out and a good home-farm, where experiments are
being tried, and surrounded by an estate in which the farm-buildings
show the effects of the landlord's good example and judicious
treatment of his tenantry. There was no want of such examples. He
admires the marquis of Rockingham, at once the most honourable of
statesmen and most judicious of improvers. He sings the praises of the
duke of Portland, the earl of Darlington,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and the duke of
Northumberland. An incautious announcement of the death of the duke of
Grafton, remembered chiefly as one of the victims of Junius, but known
to Young for his careful experiments in sheep-breeding, produced a
burst of tears, which, as he believed, cost him his eyesight. His
friend, the fifth duke of Bedford (died 1802), was one of the greatest
improvers for the South, and was succeeded by another friend, the
famous Coke of Holkham, afterwards earl of Leicester, who is said to
have spent half a million upon the improvement of his property. Young
appeals to the class in which such men were leaders, and urges them,
not against their wishes, we may suppose, and, no doubt, with much
good sense, to take to their task in the true spirit of business.
Nothing, he declares, is more out of place than the boast of some
great landowners that they never raise their rents.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> High rents
produce industry. The man who doubles his rents benefits the country
more than he benefits himself. Even in Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> a rise of rents is
one great cause of improvement, though the rent should not be
excessive, and the system of middlemen is altogether detestable. One
odd suggestion is characteristic.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He hears that wages are higher
in London than elsewhere. Now, he says, in a trading country low wages
are essential. He wonders, therefore, that the legislature does not
limit the growth of London.</p>

<p>This, we may guess, is one of the petulant utterances of early years
which he would have disavowed or qualified upon maturer reflection.
But Young is essentially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
an apostle of the 'glorious spirit of
improvement,'<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> which has converted Norfolk sheep-walks into arable
fields, and was spreading throughout the country and even into
Ireland. His hero is the energetic landowner, who makes two blades of
grass grow where one grew before; who introduces new breeds of cattle
and new courses of husbandry. He is so far in sympathy with the
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, although he says of that book that, while he
knows of 'no abler work,' he knows of none 'fuller of poisonous
errors.'<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Young, that is, sympathised with the doctrine of the
physiocrats that agriculture was the one source of real wealth, and
took Smith to be too much on the side of commerce. Young, however, was
as enthusiastic a free-trader as Smith. He naturally denounces the
selfishness of the manufacturers who, in 1788, objected to the free
export of English wool,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> but he also assails monopoly in general.
The whole system, he says (on occasion of Pitt's French treaty), is
rotten to the core. The 'vital spring and animating soul of commerce
is <small>LIBERTY</small>.'<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Though he talks of the balance of trade, he argues in
the spirit of Smith or Cobden that we are benefited by the wealth of
our customers. If we have to import more silk, we shall export more
cloth. Young, indeed, was everything but a believer in any dogmatic or
consistent system of Political Economy, or, as he still calls it,
Political Arithmetic. His opinions were not of the kind which can be
bound to any rigid formul&aelig;. After investigating the restrictions of
rent and wages in different districts, he quietly accepts the
conclusion that the difference is due to accident.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
has as yet
no fear of Malthus before his eyes. He is roused to indignation by the
pessimist theory then common, that population was decaying.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Everywhere he sees signs of progress; buildings, plantations, woods,
and canals. Employment, he says, creates population, stimulates
industry, and attracts labour from backward districts. The increase of
numbers is an unqualified benefit. He has no dread of excess. In
Ireland, he observes, no one is fool enough to deny that population is
increasing, though people deny it in England, 'even in the most
productive period of her industry and wealth.'<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> One cause of this
blessing is the absence or the poor-law. The English poor-law is
detestable to him for a reason which contrasts significantly with the
later opinion. The laws were made 'in the very spirit of
depopulation'; they are 'monuments of barbarity and mischief'; for
they give to every parish an interest in keeping down the population.
This tendency was in the eyes of the later economist a redeeming
feature in the old system; though it had been then so modified as to
stimulate what they took to be the curse, as Young held it to be the
blessing, of a rapid increase of population.</p>

<p>With such views Young was a keen advocate of the process of enclosure
which was going on with increasing rapidity. He found a colleague, who
may be briefly noticed as a remarkable representative of the same
movement. Sir John Sinclair (1754-1835)<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> was heir to an estate of
sixty thousand acres in Caithness which produced only &pound;2300 a year,
subject to many encumbrances.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
The region was still in a primitive
state. There were no roads: agriculture was of the crudest kind; part
of the rent was still paid in feudal services; the natives were too
ignorant or lazy to fish, and there were no harbours. Trees were
scarce enough to justify Johnson, and a list of all the trees in the
country included currant-bushes.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Sinclair was a pupil of the poet
Logan: studied under Blair at Edinburgh and Millar at Glasgow; became
known to Adam Smith, and, after a short time at Oxford, was called to
the English bar. Sinclair was a man of enormous energy, though not of
vivacious intellect. He belonged to the prosaic breed, which created
the 'dismal science,' and seems to have been regarded as a stupendous
bore. Bores, however, represent a social force not to be despised, and
Sinclair was no exception.</p>

<p>His father died when he was sixteen. When twenty years old he
collected his tenants, and in one night made a road across a hill
which had been pronounced impracticable. He was an enthusiastic
admirer of Gaelic traditions; defended the authenticity of Ossian;
supported Highland games, and brought Italian travellers to listen to
the music of the bagpipes. When he presented himself to his tenants in
the Highland costume, on the withdrawal of its prohibition, they
expected him to lead them in a foray upon the lowlands in the name of
Charles Edward. He afterwards raised a regiment of 'fencibles' which
served in Ireland in 1798, and, when disbanded, sent a large
contingent to the Egyptian expedition. But he rendered more peaceful
services to his country. He formed new farms; he enclosed several
thousand acres; as head
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of the 'British Wool Society,' he introduced
the Cheviots or 'long sheep' to the North&mdash;an improvement which is
said to have doubled the rents of many estates; he introduced
agricultural shows; he persuaded government in 1801 to devote the
proceeds of the confiscated estates of Jacobites to the improvement of
Scottish communications; he helped to introduce fisheries and even
manufactures; and was a main agent in the change which made Caithness
one of the most rapidly improving parts of the country. His son
assures us that he took every means to obviate the incidental evils
which have been the pretexts of denunciators of similar improvements.
Sinclair gained a certain reputation by a <i>History of the Revenue</i>
(1785-90), and, like Malthus, travelled on the Continent to improve
his knowledge. His first book finished, he began the great statistical
work by which he is best remembered. He is said to have introduced
into English the name of 'statistics,' for the researches of which all
economical writers were beginning to feel the necessity. He certainly
did much to introduce the reality. Sinclair circulated a number of
queries (upon 'natural history,' 'population,' 'productions,' and
'miscellaneous' informations) to every parish minister in Scotland. He
surmounted various jealousies naturally excited, and the ultimate
result was the <i>Statistical Account of Scotland</i>, which appeared in
twenty-one volumes between 1791 and 1799.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It gives an account of
every parish in Scotland, and was of great value as supplying a basis
for all social investigations. Sinclair bore the expense, and gave the
profits to the 'Sons of the Clergy.
'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
In 1793 Sinclair, who had been
in parliament since 1780, made himself useful to Pitt in connection
with the issue of exchequer bills to meet the commercial crisis. He
begged in return for the foundation of a Board of Agriculture. He
became the president and Arthur Young the secretary;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and the board
represented their common aspirations. It was a rather anomalous body,
something between a government office and such an institution as the
Royal Society; and was supported by an annual grant of &pound;3000. The
first aim of the board was to produce a statistical account of England
on the plan of the Scottish account. The English clergy, however, were
suspicious; they thought, it seems, that the collection of statistics
meant an attack upon tithes; and Young's frequent denunciation of
tithes as discouraging agricultural improvement suggests some excuse
for the belief. The plan had to be dropped; a less thoroughgoing
description of the counties was substituted; and a good many 'Views'
of the agriculture of different counties were published in 1794 and
succeeding years. The board did its best to be active with narrow
means. It circulated information, distributed medals, and brought
agricultural improvers together. It encouraged the publication of
Erasmus Darwin's <i>Phytologia</i> (1799), and procured a series of
lectures from Humphry Davy, afterwards published as <i>Elements of
Agricultural Chemistry</i> (1813). Sinclair also claims to have
encouraged Macadam (1756-1836), the road-maker, and Meikle, the
inventor of the thrashing-machine.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
One great aim of the board was to
promote enclosures. Young observes in the introductory paper to the
<i>Annals</i> that within forty years nine hundred bills had been passed
affecting about a million acres. This included wastes, but the greater
part was already cultivated under the 'constraint and imperfection of
the open field system,' a relic of the 'barbarity of our ancestors.'
Enclosures involved procuring acts of parliament&mdash;a consequent
expenditure, as Young estimates, of some &pound;2000 in each case;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and
as they were generally obtained by the great landowners, there was a
frequent neglect of the rights of the poor and of the smaller holders.
The remedy proposed was a general enclosure act; and such an act
passed the House of Commons in 1798, but was thrown out by the Lords.
An act was not obtained till after the Reform Bill. Sinclair, however,
obtained some modification of the procedure; which, it is said,
facilitated the passage of private bills. They became more numerous in
later years, though other causes obviously co-operated. Meanwhile, it
is characteristic that Sinclair and Young regarded wastes as a
backwoodsman regarded a forest. The incidental injury to poor
commoners was not unnoticed, and became one of the topics of Cobbett's
eloquence. But to the ardent agriculturist the existence of a bit of
waste land was a simple proof of barbarism. Sinclair's favourite
toast, we are told, was 'May commons become uncommon'&mdash;his one attempt
at a joke. He prayed that Epping Forest and Finchley Common might pass
under the yoke as well as our foreign enemies. Young is driven out of
all patience by the sight of 'fern, ling, and other trumpery'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
usurping the place of possible arable fields.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> He groans in spirit
upon Salisbury Plain, which might be made to produce all the corn we
import.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Enfield Chase, he declares, is a 'real nuisance to the
public.'<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> We may be glad that the zeal for enclosure was not
successful in all its aims; but this view of philanthropic and
energetic improvers is characteristic.</p>

<p>It is said<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> that Young and Sinclair ruined the Board of Agriculture
by making it a kind of political debating club. It died in 1822.
Sinclair obtained an appointment in Scotland, and continued to labour
unremittingly. He carried on a correspondence with all manner of
people, including Washington, Eldon, Catholic bishops in Ireland,
financiers and agriculturists on the Continent, and the most active
economists in England. He suggested a subject for a poem to Scott.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
He wrote pamphlets about cash-payments, Catholic Emancipation, and the
Reform Bill, always disagreeing with all parties. He projected four
codes which were to summarise all human knowledge upon health,
agriculture, political economy, and religion. <i>The Code of Health</i> (4
vols., 1807) went through six editions; <i>The Code of Agriculture</i>
appeared in 1829; but the world has not been enriched by the others.
He died at Edinburgh on the 21st September 1835.</p>

<p>I have dwelt so far upon Young because he is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
best representative
of that 'glorious spirit of improvement' which was transforming the
whole social structure. Young's view of the French revolution
indicates one marked characteristic of that spirit. He denounces the
French seigneur because he is lethargic. He admires the English
nobleman because he is energetic. The French noble may even deserve
confiscation; but he has not the slightest intention of applying the
same remedy in England, where squires and noblemen are the very source
of all improvement. He holds that government is everything, and
admires the great works of the French despotism: and yet he is a
thorough admirer of the liberties enjoyed under the British
Constitution, the essential nature of which makes similar works
impossible. I need not ask whether Young's logic could be justified;
though it would obviously require for justification a thoroughly
'empirical' view, or, in other words, the admission that different
circumstances may require totally different institutions. The view,
however, which was congenial to the prevalent spirit of improvement
must be noted.</p>

<p>It might be stated as a paradox that, whereas in France the most
palpable evils arose from the excessive power of the central
government, and in England the most palpable evils arose from the
feebleness of the central government, the French reformers demanded
more government and the English reformers demanded less government.
'Everything for the people, nothing by the people,' was, as Mr. Morley
remarks,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> the maxim of the French
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
economists. The solution seems
to be easy. In France, reformers such as Turgot and the economists
were in favour of an enlightened despotism, because the state meant a
centralised power which might be turned against the aristocracy. Once
'enlightened' it would suppress the exclusive privileges of a class
which, doing nothing in return, had become a mere burthen or dead
weight encumbering all social development. But in England the
privileged class was identical with the governing class. The political
liberty of which Englishmen were rightfully proud, the 'rule of law'
which made every official responsible to the ordinary course of
justice, and the actual discharge of their duties by the governing
order, saved it from being the objects of a jealous class hatred.
While in France government was staggering under an ever-accumulating
resentment against the aristocracy, the contemporary position in
England was, on the whole, one of political apathy. The country,
though it had lost its colonies, was making unprecedented progress in
wealth; commerce, manufactures, and agriculture were being developed
by the energy of individuals; and Pitt was beginning to apply Adam
Smith's principles to finance. The cry for parliamentary reform died
out: neither Whigs nor Tories really cared for it; and the 'glorious
spirit of improvement' showed itself in an energy which had little
political application. The nobility was not an incubus suppressing
individual energy and confronted by the state, but was itself the
state; and its individual members were often leaders in industrial
improvement. Discontent, therefore, took in the main a different form.
Some government was, of course, necessary, and the existing system was
too much in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
harmony, even in its defects, with the social order to
provoke any distinct revolutionary sentiment. Englishmen were not only
satisfied with their main institutions, but regarded them with
exaggerated complacency. But, though there was no organic disorder,
there were plenty of abuses to be remedied. The ruling class, it
seemed, did its duties in the main, but took unconscionable
perquisites in return. If it 'farmed' them, it was right that it
should have a beneficial interest in the concern; but that interest
might be excessive. In many directions abuses were growing up which
required remedy, though not a subversion of the system under which
they had been generated. It was not desired&mdash;unless by a very few
theorists&mdash;to make any sweeping redistribution of power; but it was
eminently desirable to find some means of better regulating many evil
practices. The attack upon such practices might ultimately
suggest&mdash;as, in fact, it did suggest&mdash;the necessity of far more
thoroughgoing reforms. For the present, however, the characteristic
mark of English reformers was this limitation of their schemes, and a
mark which is especially evident in Bentham and his followers. I will
speak, therefore, of the many questions which were arising, partly for
these reasons and partly because the Utilitarian theory was in great
part moulded by the particular problems which they had to argue.

<h3>SOCIAL PROBLEMS</h3>

<p class="scs">I. <a name="III_I" id="III_I"></a>PAUPERISM</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Perhaps the gravest of all the problems which were to occupy the
coming generation was the problem of pauperism. The view taken by the
Utilitarians was highly characteristic and important. I will try to
indicate the general position of intelligent observers at the end of
the century by referring to the remarkable book of Sir Frederick
Morton Eden. Its purport is explained by the title: 'The State of the
Poor; or, an History of the Labouring Classes of England from the
Norman Conquest to the present period; in which are particularly
considered their domestic economy, with respect to diet, dress, fuel,
and habitation; and the various plans which have from time to time
been proposed and adopted for the relief of the poor' (3 vols. 4to,
1797). Eden<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> (1766-1809) was a man of good family and nephew of the
first Lord Auckland, who negotiated Pitt's commercial treaty. He
graduated as B.A. from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1787; married in
1792, and at his death (14th Nov. 1809) was chairman of the Globe
Insurance Company. He wrote
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
various pamphlets upon economical topics;
contributed letters signed 'Philanglus' to Cobbett's <i>Porcupine</i>, the
anti-jacobin paper of the day; and is described by Bentham<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> as a
'declared disciple' and a 'highly valued friend.' He may be reckoned,
therefore, as a Utilitarian, though politically he was a Conservative.
He seems to have been a man of literary tastes as well as a man of
business, and his book is a clear and able statement of the points at
issue.</p>

<p>Eden's attention had been drawn to the subject by the distress which
followed the outbreak of the revolutionary war. He employed an agent
who travelled through the country for a year with a set of queries
drawn up after the model of those prepared by Sinclair for his
<i>Statistical Account of Scotland</i>. He thus anticipated the remarkable
investigation made in our own time by Mr. Charles Booth. Eden made
personal inquiries and studied the literature of the subject. He had a
precursor in Richard Burn (1709-1785), whose <i>History of the
Poor-laws</i> appeared in 1764, and a competitor in John Ruggles, whose
<i>History of the Poor</i> first appeared in Arthur Young's <i>Annals</i>, and
was published as a book in 1793 (second edition, 1797). Eden's work
eclipsed Ruggles's. It has a permanent value as a collection of facts;
and was a sign of the growing sense of the importance of accurate
statistical research. The historian of the social condition of the
people should be grateful to one who broke ground at a time when the
difficulty of obtaining a sound base for social inquiries began to
make itself generally felt. The value of the book for historical
purposes lies beyond my sphere. His first volume, I may say, gives a
history of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
legislation from the earliest period; and contains also a
valuable account of the voluminous literature which had grown up
during the two preceding centuries. The other two summarise the
reports which he had received. I will only say enough to indicate
certain critical points. Eden's book unfortunately was to mark, not a
solution of the difficulty but, the emergence of a series of problems
which were to increase in complexity and ominous significance through
the next generation.</p>

<p>The general history of the poor-law is sufficiently familiar.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The
medi&aelig;val statutes take us to a period at which the labourer was still
regarded as a serf; and a man who had left his village was treated
like a fugitive slave. A long series of statutes regulated the
treatment of the 'vagabond.' The vagabond, however, had become
differentiated from the pauper. The decay of the ancient order of
society and its corresponding institutions had led to a new set of
problems; and the famous statute of Elizabeth (1601) had laid down the
main lines of the system which is still in operation.</p>

<p>When the labourer was regarded as in a servile condition, he might be
supported from the motives which lead an owner to support his slaves,
or by the charitable energies organised by ecclesiastical
institutions. He had now ceased to be a serf, and the institutions
which helped the poor man or maintained the beggar were wrecked. The
Elizabethan statute gave him, therefore, a legal claim to be
supported, and, on the other hand, directed that he should be made to
work for his living. The assumption is still that every man is a
member of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
little social circle. He belongs to his parish, and it is
his fellow-parishioners who are bound to support him. So long as this
corresponded to facts, the system could work satisfactorily. With the
spread of commerce, and the growth of a less settled population,
difficulties necessarily arose. The pauper and the vagabond represent
a kind of social extravasation; the 'masterless man' who has strayed
from his legitimate place or has become a superfluity in his own
circle. The vagabond could be flogged, sent to prison, or if necessary
hanged, but it was more difficult to settle what to do with a man who
was not a criminal, but simply a product in excess of demand. All
manner of solutions had been suggested by philanthropists and partly
adopted by the legislature. One point which especially concerns us is
the awkwardness or absence of an appropriate administrative machinery.</p>

<p>The parish, the unit on which the pauper had claims, meant the persons
upon whom the poor-rate was assessed. These were mainly farmers and
small tradesmen who formed the rather vague body called the vestry.
'Overseers' were appointed by the ratepayers themselves; they were not
paid, and the disagreeable office was taken in turn for short periods.
The most obvious motive with the average ratepayer was of course to
keep down the rates and to get the burthen of the poor as much as
possible out of his own parish. Each parish had at least an interest
in economy. But the economical interest also produced flagrant evils.</p>

<p>In the first place, there was the war between parishes. The law of
settlement&mdash;which was to decide to what parish a pauper
belonged&mdash;originated in an act of 1662.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Eden observes that the short
clause in this short act had brought more profit to the lawyers than
'any other point in the English jurisprudence.'<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> It is said that
the expense of such a litigation before the act of 1834 averaged from
&pound;300,000 to &pound;350,000 a year.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Each parish naturally endeavoured to
shift the burthen upon its neighbours; and was protected by laws which
enabled it to resist the immigration of labourers or actually to expel
them when likely to become chargeable. This law is denounced by Adam
Smith<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> as a 'violation of natural liberty and justice.' It was
often harder, he declared, for a poor man to cross the artificial
boundaries of his parish than to cross a mountain ridge or an arm of
the sea. There was, he declared, hardly a poor man in England over
forty who had not been at some time 'cruelly oppressed' by the working
of this law. Eden thinks that Smith had exaggerated the evil: but a
law which operated by preventing a free circulation of labour, and
made it hard for a poor man to seek the best price for his only
saleable commodity, was, so far, opposed to the fundamental principles
common to Smith and Eden. The law, too, might be used oppressively by
the niggardly and narrow-minded. The overseer, as Burn complained,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
was often a petty tyrant: his aim was to depopulate his parish; to
prevent the poor from obtaining a settlement; to make the workhouse a
terror by placing it under the management of a bully; and by all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
kinds of chicanery to keep down the rates at whatever cost to the
comfort and morality of the poor. This explains the view taken by
Arthur Young, and generally accepted at the period, that the poor-law
meant depopulation. Workhouses had been started in the seventeenth
century<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> with the amiable intention of providing the industrious
poor with work. Children might be trained to industry and the pauper
might be made self-supporting. Workhouses were expected that is, to
provide not only work but wages. Defoe, in his <i>Giving Alms no
Charity</i>, pointed out the obvious objections to the workhouse
considered as an institution capable of competing with the ordinary
industries. Workhouses, in fact, soon ceased to be profitable. Their
value, however, in supplying a test for destitution was recognised;
and by an act of 1722, parishes were allowed to set up workhouses,
separately or in combination, and to strike off the lists of the poor
those who refused to enter them. This was the germ of the later
'workhouse test.'<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> When grievances arose, the invariable plan, as
Nicholls observes,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> was to increase the power of the justices.
Their discretion was regarded 'as a certain cure for every shortcoming
of the law and every evil arising out of it.' The great report of 1834
traces this tendency<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> to a clause in an act passed in the reign of
William <small>III.</small>, which was intended to allow the justices to check the
extravagance of parish officers. They were empowered to strike off
persons improperly relieved. This incidental regulation, widened by
subsequent interpretations,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
allowed the magistrates to order relief,
and thereby introduced an incredible amount of demoralisation.</p>

<p>The course was natural enough, and indeed apparently inevitable. The
justices of the peace represented the only authority which could be
called in to regulate abuses arising from the incapacity and narrow
local interests of the multitudinous vestries. The schemes of
improvement generally involved some plan for a larger area. If a
hundred or a county were taken for the unit, the devices which
depopulated a parish would no longer be applicable.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The only
scheme actually carried was embodied in 'Gilbert's act' (1782),
obtained by Thomas Gilbert (1720-1798), an agent of the duke of
Bridgewater, and an active advocate of poor-law reform in the House of
Commons. This scheme was intended as a temporary expedient during the
distress caused by the American War; and a larger and more permanent
scheme which it was to introduce failed to become law. It enabled
parishes to combine if they chose to provide common workhouses, and to
appoint 'guardians.' The justices, as usual, received more powers in
order to suppress the harsh dealing of the old parochial authorities.
The guardians, it was assumed, could always find 'work,' and they were
to relieve the able-bodied without applying the workhouse test. The
act, readily adopted, thus became a landmark in the growth of
laxity.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
At the end of the century a rapid development of pauperism had taken
place. The expense, as Eden had to complain, had doubled in twenty
years. This took place simultaneously with the great development of
manufactures. It is not perhaps surprising, though it may be
melancholy, that increase of wealth shall be accompanied by increase
of pauperism. Where there are many rich men, there will be a better
field for thieves and beggars. A life of dependence becomes easier
though it need not necessarily be adopted. Whatever may have been the
relation of the two phenomena, the social revolution made the old
social arrangements more inadequate. Great aggregations of workmen
were formed in towns, which were still only villages in a legal sense.
Fluctuations of trade, due to war or speculation, brought distress to
the improvident; and the old assumption that every man had a proper
place in a small circle, where his neighbours knew all about him, was
further than ever from being verified. One painful result was already
beginning to show itself. Neglected children in great towns had
already excited compassion. Thomas Coram (1668?-1751) had been shocked
by the sight of dying children exposed in the streets of London, and
succeeded in establishing the Foundling Hospital (founded in 1742). In
1762, Jonas Hanway (1712-1786) obtained a law for boarding out
children born within the bills of mortality. The demand for children's
labour, produced by the factories, seemed naturally enough to offer a
better chance for extending such charities. Unfortunately among the
people who took advantage of it were parish officials, eager to get
children off their hands, and manufacturers concerned only to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> make
money out of childish labour. Hence arose the shameful system for
which remedies (as I shall have to notice) had to be sought in a later
generation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the outbreak of the revolutionary war had made the question
urgent. When Manchester trade suffered, as Eden tells us in his
reports, many workmen enlisted in the army, and left their children to
be supported by the parish. Bad seasons followed in 1794 and 1795, and
there was great distress in the agricultural districts. The governing
classes became alarmed. In December 1795 Whitbread introduced a bill
providing that the justices of the peace should fix a minimum rate of
wages. Upon a motion for the second reading, Pitt made the famous
speech (12th December) including the often-quoted statement that when
a man had a family, relief should be 'a matter of right and honour,
instead of a ground of opprobrium and contempt.'<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Pitt had in the
same speech shown his reading of Adam Smith by dwelling upon the
general objections to state interference with wages, and had argued
that more was to be gained by removing the restrictions upon the free
movement of labour. He undertook to produce a comprehensive measure;
and an elaborate bill of 130 clauses was prepared in 1796.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The
rates were to be used to supplement inadequate wages; 'schools of
industry' were to be formed for the support of superabundant children;
loans might be made to the poor for the purchase of a cow;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and the
possession of property was not to disqualify for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the receiving
relief. In short, the bill seems to have been a model of misapplied
benevolence. The details were keenly criticised by Bentham, and the
bill never came to the birth. Other topics were pressing enough at
this time to account for the failure of a measure so vast in its
scope. Meanwhile something had to be done. On 6th May 1795 the
Berkshire magistrates had passed certain resolutions called from their
place of meeting, the 'Speenhamland Act of Parliament.' They provided
that the rate of wages of a labourer should be increased in proportion
to the price of corn and to the number of his family&mdash;a rule which, as
Eden observes, tended to discourage economy of food in times of
scarcity. They also sanctioned the disastrous principle of paying part
of the wages out of rates. An act passed in 1796 repealed the old
restrictions upon out-door relief; and thus, during the hard times
that were to follow, the poor-laws were adapted to produce the state
of things in which, as Cobbett says (in 1821) 'every labourer who has
children is now regularly and constantly a pauper.'<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The result
represents a curious compromise. The landowners, whether from
benevolence or fear of revolution, desired to meet the terrible
distress of the times. Unfortunately their spasmodic interference was
guided by no fixed principles, and acted upon a class of institutions
not organised upon any definite system. The general effect seems to
have been that the ratepayers, no longer allowed to 'depopulate,'
sought to turn the compulsory stream of charity partly into their own
pockets. If they were forced to support paupers, they could contrive
to save the payment of wages. They could use the labour of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
rate-supported pauper instead of employing independent workmen. The
evils thus produced led before long to most important discussions.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
The ordinary view of the poor-law was inverted. The prominent evil was
the reckless increase of a degraded population instead of the
restriction of population. Eden's own view is sufficiently indicative
of the light in which the facts showed themselves to intelligent
economists. As a disciple of Adam Smith, he accepts the rather vague
doctrine of his master about the 'balance' between labour and capital.
If labour exceeds capital, he says, the labourer must starve 'in spite
of all political regulations.'<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> He therefore looks with disfavour
upon the whole poor-law system. It is too deeply rooted to be
abolished, but he thinks that the amount to be raised should not be
permitted to exceed the sum levied on an average of previous years.
The only certain result of Pitt's measure would be a vast expenditure
upon a doubtful experiment: and one main purpose of his publication
was to point out the objections to the plan. He desires what seemed at
that time to be almost hopeless, a national system of education; but
his main doctrine is the wisdom of reliance upon individual effort.
The truth of the maxim '<i>pas trop gouverner</i>,' he says,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> has never
been better illustrated than by the contrast between friendly
societies and the poor-laws. Friendly societies had been known, though
they were still on a humble scale, from the beginning of the century,
and had tended to diminish pauperism in spite of the poor-laws. Eden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
gives many accounts of them. They seem to have suggested a scheme
proposed by the worthy Francis Maseres<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> (1731-1824) in 1772 for the
establishment of life annuities. A bill to give effect to this scheme
passed the House of Commons in 1773 with the support of Burke and
Savile, but was thrown out in the House of Lords. In 1786 John Acland
(died 1796), a Devonshire clergyman and justice of the peace, proposed
a scheme for uniting the whole nation into a kind of friendly society
for the support of the poor when out of work and in old age. It was
criticised by John Howlett (1731-1804), a clergyman who wrote much
upon the poor-laws. He attributes the growth of pauperism to the rise
of prices, and calculates that out of an increased expenditure of
&pound;700,000, &pound;219,000 had been raised by the rich, and the remainder
'squeezed out of the flesh, blood, and bones of the poor,' An act for
establishing Acland's crude scheme failed next year in parliament.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
The merit of the societies, according to Eden, was their tendency to
stimulate self-help; and how to preserve that merit, while making them
compulsory, was a difficult problem. I have said enough to mark a
critical and characteristic change of opinion. One source of evil
pointed out by contemporaries had been the absence of any central
power which could regulate and systematise the action of the petty
local bodies. The very possibility
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of such organisation, however,
seems to have been simply inconceivable. When the local bodies became
lavish instead of over-frugal, the one remedy suggested was to abolish
the system altogether.</p>

<p class="scs">II. <a name="III_II" id="III_II"></a>THE POLICE</p>

<p>The system of 'self-government' showed its weak side in this
direction. It meant that an important function was intrusted to small
bodies, quite incompetent of acting upon general principles, and
perfectly capable of petty jobbing, when unrestrained by any effective
supervision. In another direction the same tendency was even more
strikingly illustrated. Municipal institutions were almost at their
lowest point of decay. Manchester and Birmingham were two of the
largest and most rapidly growing towns. By the end of the century
Manchester had a population of 90,000 and Birmingham of 70,000. Both
were ruled, as far as they were ruled, by the remnants of old manorial
institutions. Aikin<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> observes that 'Manchester (in 1795) remains an
open town; destitute (probably to its advantage) of a corporation, and
unrepresented in parliament.' It was governed by a 'boroughreeve' and
two constables elected annually at the court-leet. William Hutton, the
quaint historian of Birmingham, tells us in 1783 that the town was
still legally a village, with a high and low bailiff, a 'high and low
taster,' two 'affeerers,' and two 'leather-sealers,' In 1752 it had
been provided with a 'court of requests' for the recovery of small
debts, and in 1769 with a body of commissioners to provide for
lighting the town. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
was the system by which, with some
modifications, Birmingham was governed till after the Reform Bill.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Hutton boasts<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> that no town was better governed or had fewer
officers. 'A town without a charter,' he says, 'is a town without a
shackle.' Perhaps he changed his opinions when his warehouses were
burnt in 1791, and the town was at the mercy of the mob till a
regiment of 'light horse' could be called in. Aikin and Hutton,
however, reflect the general opinion at a time when the town
corporations had become close and corrupt bodies, and were chiefly
'shackles' upon the energy of active members of the community. I must
leave the explanation of this decay to historians. I will only observe
that what would need explanation would seem to be rather the absence
than the presence of corruption. The English borough was not
stimulated by any pressure from a central government; nor was it a
semi-independent body in which every citizen had the strongest motives
for combining to support its independence against neighbouring towns
or invading nobles. The lower classes were ignorant, and probably
would be rather hostile than favourable to any such modest
interference with dirt and disorder as would commend themselves to the
officials. Naturally, power was left to the little cliques of
prosperous tradesmen, who formed close corporations, and spent the
revenues upon feasts or squandered them by corrupt practices. Here, as
in the poor-law, the insufficiency of the administrative body suggests
to contemporaries, not its reform, but its superfluity.</p>

<p>The most striking account of some of the natural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
results is in
Colquhoun's<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> <i>Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis</i>. Patrick
Colquhoun (1745-1820), an energetic Scot, was born at Dumbarton in
1745, had been in business at Glasgow, where he was provost in 1782
and 1783, and in 1789 settled in London. In 1792 he obtained through
Dundas an appointment to one of the new police magistracies created by
an act of that year. He took an active part in many schemes of social
reform; and his book gives an account of the investigations by which
his schemes were suggested and justified. It must be said, however,
parenthetically, that his statistics scarcely challenge implicit
confidence. Like Sinclair and Eden, he saw the importance of obtaining
facts and figures, but his statements are suspiciously precise and
elaborate.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The broad facts are clear enough.</p>

<p>London was, he says, three miles broad and twenty-five in
circumference. The population in 1801 was 641,000. It was the largest
town, and apparently the most chaotic collection of dwellings in the
civilised world. There were, as Colquhoun asserts<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> in an
often-quoted passage, 20,000 people in it, who got up every morning
without knowing how they would get through the day. There were 5000
public-houses, and 50,000 women supported, wholly or partly, by
prostitution. The revenues raised by crime amounted, as he calculates,
to an annual sum of, &pound;2,000,000. There were whole classes of
professional thieves, more or less organised in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
gangs, which acted in
support of each other. There were gangs on the river, who boarded
ships at night, or lay in wait round the warehouses. The government
dockyards were systematically plundered, and the same article often
sold four times over to the officials. The absence of patrols gave
ample chance to the highwaymen then peculiar to England. Their
careers, commemorated in the <i>Newgate Calendar</i>, had a certain flavour
of Robin Hood romance, and their ranks were recruited from dissipated
apprentices and tradesmen in difficulty. The fields round London were
so constantly plundered that the rent was materially lowered. Half the
hackney coachmen, he says,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> were in league with thieves. The
number of receiving houses for stolen goods had increased in twenty
years from 300 to 3000.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Coining was a flourishing trade, and
according to Colquhoun employed several thousand persons.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Gambling had taken a fresh start about 1777 and 1778<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>; and the
keepers of tables had always money enough at command to make
convictions almost impossible. French refugees at the revolution had
introduced <i>rouge et noir</i>; and Colquhoun estimates the sums yearly
lost in gambling-houses at over &pound;7,000,000. The gamblers might perhaps
appeal not only to the practices of their betters in the days of Fox,
but to the public lotteries. Colquhoun had various correspondents, who
do not venture to propose the abolition of a system which sanctioned
the practice, but who hope to diminish the facility for supplementary
betting on the results of the official drawing.</p>

<p>The war had tended to increase the number of loose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and desperate
marauders who swarmed in the vast labyrinth of London streets. When we
consider the nature of the police by which these evils were to be
checked, and the criminal law which they administered, the wonder is
less that there were sometimes desperate riots (as in 1780) than that
London should have been ever able to resist a mob. Colquhoun, though a
patriotic Briton, has to admit that the French despots had at last
created an efficient police. The emperor, Joseph <small>II.</small>, he says,
inquired for an Austrian criminal supposed to have escaped to Paris.
You will find him, replied the head of the French police, at No. 93 of
such a street in Vienna on the second-floor room looking upon such a
church; and there he was. In England a criminal could hide himself in
a herd of his like, occasionally disturbed by the inroad of a 'Bow
Street runner,' the emissary of the 'trading justices,' formerly
represented by the two Fieldings. An act of 1792 created seven new
offices, to one of which Colquhoun had been appointed. They had one
hundred and eighty-nine paid officers under them. There were also
about one thousand constables. These were small tradesmen or artisans
upon whom the duty was imposed without remuneration for a year by
their parish, that is, by one of seventy independent bodies. A 'Tyburn
ticket,' given in reward for obtaining the conviction of a criminal
exempted a man from the discharge of such offices, and could be bought
for from &pound;15 to &pound;25. There were also two thousand watchmen receiving
from 8&frac12;d. up to 2s. a night. These were the true successors of
Dogberry; often infirm or aged persons appointed to keep them out of
the workhouse.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
The management of this distracted force thus depended
upon a miscellaneous set of bodies; the paid magistrates, the
officials of the city, the justices of the peace for Middlesex, and
the seventy independent parishes.</p>

<p>The law was as defective as the administration. Colquhoun represents
the philanthropic impulse of the day, and notices<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> that in 1787
Joseph <small>II.</small> had abolished capital punishment. His chief authority for
more merciful methods is Beccaria; and it is worth remarking, for
reasons which will appear hereafter, that he does not in this
connection refer to Bentham, although he speaks enthusiastically<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
of Bentham's model prison, the Panopticon. Colquhoun shows how
strangely the severity of the law was combined with its extreme
capaciousness. He quotes Bacon<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> for the statement that the law was
a 'heterogeneous mass concocted too often on the spur of the moment,'
and gives sufficient proofs of its truth. He desires, for example, a
law to punish receivers of stolen goods, and says that there were
excellent laws in existence. Unfortunately one law applied exclusively
to the case of pewter-pots, and another exclusively to the precious
metals; neither could be used as against receivers of horses or bank
notes.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> So a man indicted under an act against stealing from ships
on navigable rivers escaped, because the barge from which he stole
happened to be aground. Gangs could afford to corrupt witnesses or to
pay knavish lawyers skilled in applying these vagaries of legislation.
Juries also disliked convicting when the penalty for coining sixpence
was the same as the penalty for killing a mother. It followed, as he
shows by statistics, that half the persons committed for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> trial
escaped by petty chicanery or corruption, or the reluctance of juries
to convict for capital offences. Only about one-fifth of the capital
sentences were executed; and many were pardoned on condition of
enlisting to improve the morals of the army. The criminals, who were
neither hanged nor allowed to escape, were sent to prisons, which were
schools of vice. After the independence of the American colonies, the
system of transportation to Australia had begun (in 1787); but the
expense was enormous, and prisoners were huddled together in the hulks
at Woolwich and Portsmouth, which had been used as a temporary
expedient. Thence they were constantly discharged, to return to their
old practices. A man, says Colquhoun,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> would deserve a statue who
should carry out a plan for helping discharged prisoners. To meet
these evils, Colquhoun proposes various remedies, such as a
metropolitan police, a public prosecutor, or even a codification or
revision of the Criminal Code, which he sees is likely to be delayed.
He also suggested, in a pamphlet of 1799, a kind of charity
organisation society to prevent the waste of funds. Many other
pamphlets of similar tendencies show his active zeal in promoting
various reforms. Colquhoun was in close correspondence with Bentham
from the year 1798,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and Bentham helped him by drawing the Thames
Police Act, passed in 1800, to give effect to some of the suggestions
in the <i>Treatise</i>.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Another set of abuses has a special connection with Bentham's
activity. Bentham had been led in 1778 to attend to the prison
question by reading Howard's book on <i>Prisons</i>; and he refers to the
'venerable friend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
who had lived an apostle and died a martyr.'<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
The career of John Howard (1726-1790) is familiar. The son of a London
tradesman, he had inherited an estate in Bedfordshire. There he
erected model cottages and village schools; and, on becoming sheriff
of the county in 1773, was led to attend to abuses in the prisons. Two
acts of parliament were passed in 1774 to remedy some of the evils
exposed, and he pursued the inquiry at home and abroad. His results
are given in his <i>State of the Prisons in England and Wales</i> (1779,
fourth edition, 1792), and his <i>Account of the Principal Lazarettos in
Europe</i> (1789). The prisoners, he says, had little food, sometimes a
penny loaf a day, and sometimes nothing; no water, no fresh air, no
sewers, and no bedding. The stench was appalling, and gaol fever
killed more than died on the gallows. Debtors and felons, men, women
and children, were huddled together; often with lunatics, who were
shown by the gaolers for money. 'Garnish' was extorted; the gaolers
kept drinking-taps; gambling flourished: and prisoners were often
cruelly ironed, and kept for long periods before trial. At Hull the
assizes had only been held once in seven years, and afterwards once in
three. It is a comfort to find that the whole number of prisoners in
England and Wales amounted, in 1780, to about 4400, 2078 of whom were
debtors, 798 felons, and 917 petty offenders. An act passed in 1779
provided for the erection of two penitentiaries. Howard was to be a
supervisor. The failure to carry out this act led, as we shall see, to
one of Bentham's most characteristic undertakings. One peculiarity
must be noted.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Howard found prisons on the continent where the
treatment was bad and torture still occasionally practised; but he
nowhere found things so bad as in England. In Holland the prisons were
so neat and clean as to make it difficult to believe that they were
prisons: and they were used as models for the legislation of 1779. One
cause of this unenviable distinction of English prisons had been
indicated by an earlier investigation. General Oglethorpe (1696-1785)
had been started in his philanthropic career by obtaining a committee
of the House of Commons in 1729 to inquire into the state of the
gaols. The foundation of the colony of Georgia as an outlet for the
population was one result of the inquiry. It led, in the first place,
however, to a trial of persons accused of atrocious cruelties at the
Fleet prison.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The trial was abortive. It appeared in the course
of the proceedings that the Fleet prison was a 'freehold,' A patent
for rebuilding it had been granted to Sir Jeremy Whichcot under
Charles <small>II.</small>, and had been sold to one Higgins, who resold it to other
persons for &pound;5000. The proprietors made their investment pay by cruel
ill-treatment of the prisoners, oppressing the poor and letting off
parts of the prison to dealers in drink. This was the general plan in
the prisons examined by Howard, and helps to account for the gross
abuses. It is one more application of the general system. As the
patron was owner of a living, and the officer of his commission, the
keeper of a prison was owner of his establishment. The paralysis of
administration which prevailed throughout the country made it natural
to farm out paupers to the master of a workhouse, and prisoners to the
proprietor of a gaol.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
The state of prisoners may be inferred not only
from Howard's authentic record but from the fictions of Fielding,
Smollett and Goldsmith; and the last echoes of the same complaints may
be found in <i>Pickwick</i> and <i>Little Dorrit</i>. The Marshalsea described
in the last was also a proprietary concern. We shall hereafter see how
Bentham proposed to treat the evils revealed by Oglethorpe and Howard.</p>

<p>Another topic treated by Colquhoun marks the initial stage of
controversies which were soon to grow warm. Colquhoun boasts of the
number of charities for which London was already conspicuous. A
growing facility for forming associations of all kinds, political,
religious, scientific, and charitable, is an obvious characteristic of
modern progress. Where in earlier times a college or a hospital had to
be endowed by a founder and invested by charter with corporate
personality, it is now necessary only to call a meeting, form a
committee, and appeal for subscriptions. Societies of various kinds
had sprung up during the century. Artists, men of science,
agriculturists, and men of literary tastes, had founded innumerable
academies and 'philosophical institutes.' The great London hospitals,
dependent upon voluntary subscriptions, had been founded during the
first half of the century. Colquhoun counts the annual revenue of
various charitable institutions at &pound;445,000, besides which the
endowments produced &pound;150,000, and the poor-rates
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
&pound;255,000.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Among
these a considerable number were intended to promote education. Here,
as in some other cases, it seems that people at the end of the century
were often taking up an impulse given a century before. So the Society
for promoting Christian Knowledge, founded in 1699, and the Society
for the Propagation of the Gospel, founded in 1701, were supplemented
by the Church Missionary Society and the Religious Tract Society, both
founded in 1799. The societies for the reformation of manners,
prevalent at the end of the seventeenth century, were taken as a model
by Wilberforce and his friends at the end of the eighteenth.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In
the same way, the first attempts at providing a general education for
the poor had been made by Archbishop Tenison, who founded a parochial
school about 1680 in order 'to check the growth of popery.' Charity
schools became common during the early part of the eighteenth century
and received various endowments. They were attacked as tending to
teach the poor too much&mdash;a very needless alarm&mdash;and also by free
thinkers, such as Mandeville, as intended outworks of the established
church. This last objection was a foretaste of the bitter religious
controversies which were to accompany the growth of an educational
system. Colquhoun says that there were 62 endowed schools in London,
from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Christ's Hospital downwards, educating about 5000 children; 237
parish schools with about 9000 children, and 3730 'private schools.'
The teaching was, of course, very imperfect, and in a report of a
committee of the House of Commons in 1818, it is calculated that about
half the children in a large district were entirely uneducated. There
was, of course, nothing in England deserving the name of a system in
educational more than in any other matters. The grammar schools
throughout the country provided more or less for the classes which
could not aspire to the public schools and universities. About a third
of the boys at Christ's Hospital were, as Coleridge tells us, sons of
clergymen.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The children of the poor were either not educated, or
picked up their letters at some charity school or such a country
dame's school as is described by Shenstone. A curious proof, however,
of rising interest in the question is given by the Sunday Schools
movement at the end of the century. Robert Raikes (1735-1811), a
printer in Gloucester and proprietor of a newspaper, joined with a
clergyman to set up a school in 1780 at a total cost of 1s. 6d. a
week. Within three or four years the plan was taken up everywhere, and
the worthy Raikes, whose newspaper had spread the news, found himself
revered as a great pioneer of philanthropy. Wesley took up the scheme
warmly; bishops condescended to approve; the king and queen were
interested, and within three or four years the number of learners was
reckoned at two or three hundred thousand. A Sunday School Association
was formed in 1785 with well known men of business at its head. Queen
Charlotte's friend, Mrs. Trimmer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
(1741-1810), took up the work near
London, and Hannah More (1745-1833) in Somersetshire. Hannah More
gives a strange account of the utter absence of any civilising
agencies in the district around Cheddar where she and her sisters
laboured. She was accused of 'methodism' and a leaning to Jacobinism,
although her views were of the most moderate kind. She wished the poor
to be able to read their Bibles and to be qualified for domestic
duties, but not to write or to be enabled to read Tom Paine or be
encouraged to rise above their position. The literary light of the
Whigs, Dr. Parr (1747-1825), showed his liberality by arguing that the
poor ought to be taught, but admitted that the enterprise had its
limits. The 'Deity Himself had fixed a great gulph between them and
the poor.' A scanty instruction given on Sundays alone was not
calculated to facilitate the passage of that gulf. By the end of the
century, however, signs of a more systematic movement were showing
themselves. Bell and Lancaster, of whom I shall have to speak, were
rival claimants for the honour of initiating a new departure in
education. The controversy which afterwards raged between the
supporters of the two systems marked a complete revolution of opinion.
Meanwhile, although the need of schools was beginning to be felt, the
appliances for education in England were a striking instance of the
general inefficiency in every department which needed combined action.
In Scotland the system of parish schools was one obvious cause of the
success of so many of the Scotsmen which excited the jealousy of
southern competitors. Even in Ireland there appears to have been a
more efficient set of schools. And yet, one remark must be suggested.
There is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
probably no period in English history at which a greater
number of poor men have risen to distinction. The greatest beyond
comparison of self-taught poets was Burns (1759-1796). The political
writer who was at the time producing the most marked effect was Thomas
Paine (1737-1809), son of a small tradesman. His successor in
influence was William Cobbett (1762-1835), son of an agricultural
labourer, and one of the pithiest of all English writers. William
Gifford (1756-1826), son of a small tradesman in Devonshire, was
already known as a satirist and was to lead Conservatives as editor of
the <i>The Quarterly Review</i>. John Dalton (1766-1842), son of a poor
weaver, was one of the most distinguished men of science. Porson
(1759-1808), the greatest Greek scholar of his time, was son of a
Norfolk parish clerk, though sagacious patrons had sent him to Eton in
his fifteenth year. The Oxford professor of Arabic, Joseph White
(1746-1814), was son of a poor weaver in the country and a man of
reputation for learning, although now remembered only for a rather
disreputable literary squabble. Robert Owen and Joseph Lancaster, both
sprung from the ranks, were leaders in social movements. I have
already spoken of such men as Watt, Telford, and Rennie; and smaller
names might be added in literature, science, and art. The
individualist virtue of 'self-help' was not confined to successful
money-making or to the wealthier classes. One cause of the literary
excellence of Burns, Paine, and Cobbett may be that, when literature
was less centralised, a writer was less tempted to desert his natural
dialect. I mention the fact, however, merely to suggest that, whatever
were then the difficulties of getting such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
schooling as is now
common, an energetic lad even in the most neglected regions might
force his way to the front.</p>

<p class="scs">IV. <a name="III_IV" id="III_IV"></a>THE SLAVE-TRADE</p>

<p>I have thus noticed the most conspicuous of the contemporary problems
which, as we shall see, provided the main tasks of Bentham and his
followers. One other topic must be mentioned as in more ways than one
characteristic of the spirit of the time. The parliamentary attack
upon the slave-trade began just before the outbreak of the revolution.
It is generally described as an almost sudden awakening of the
national conscience. That it appealed to that faculty is undeniable,
and, moreover, it is at least a remarkable instance of legislative
action upon purely moral grounds. It is true that in this case the
conscience was the less impeded because it was roused chiefly by the
sins of men's neighbours. The slave-trading class was a comparative
excrescence. Their trade could be attacked without such widespread
interference with the social order as was implied, for example, in
remedying the grievances of paupers or of children in factories. The
conflict with morality, again, was so plain as to need no
demonstration. It seems to be a questionable logic which assumes the
merit of a reformer to be in proportion to the flagrancy of the evil
assailed. The more obvious the case, surely the less the virtue needed
in the assailant. However this may be, no one can deny the moral
excellence of such men as Wilberforce and Clarkson, nor the real
change in the moral standard implied by the success of their
agitation. But another question remains, which is indicated by a later
controversy.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
The followers of Wilberforce and of Clarkson were
jealous of each other. Each party tried to claim the chief merit for
its hero. Each was, I think, unjust to the other. The underlying
motive was the desire to obtain credit for the 'Evangelicals' or their
rivals as the originators of a great movement. Without touching the
personal details it is necessary to say something of the general
sentiments implied. In his history of the agitation,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Clarkson
gives a quaint chart, showing how the impulse spread from various
centres till it converged upon a single area, and his facts are
significant.</p>

<p>That a great change had taken place is undeniable. Protestant England
had bargained with Catholic Spain in the middle of the century for the
right of supplying slaves to America, while at the peace of 1814
English statesmen were endeavouring to secure a combination of all
civilised powers against the trade. Smollett, in 1748, makes the
fortune of his hero, Roderick Random, by placing him as mate of a
slave-ship under the ideal sailor, Bowling. About the same time John
Newton (1725-1807), afterwards the venerated teacher of Cowper and the
Evangelicals, was in command of a slaver, and enjoying 'sweeter and
more frequent hours of divine communion' than he had elsewhere known.
He had no scruples, though he had the grace to pray 'to be fixed in a
more humane calling.' In later years he gave the benefit of his
experience to the abolitionists.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> A new sentiment, however, was
already showing itself.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Clarkson collects various instances.
Southern's Oroonoco, founded on a story by Mrs. Behn, and Steele's
story of Inkle and Yarico in an early <i>Spectator</i>, Pope's poor Indian
in the <i>Essay on Man</i>, and allusions by Thomson, Shenstone, and
Savage, show that poets and novelists could occasionally turn the
theme to account. Hutcheson, the moralist, incidentally condemns
slavery; and divines such as Bishops Hayter and Warburton took the
same view in sermons before the Society for the Propagation of
Christian Knowledge. Johnson, 'last of the Tories' though he was, had
a righteous hatred for the system.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> He toasted the next
insurrection of negroes in the West Indies, and asked why we always
heard the 'loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes'?
Thomas Day (1748-1789), as an ardent follower of Rousseau, wrote the
<i>Dying Negro</i> in 1773, and, in the same spirit, denounced the
inconsistencies of slave-holding champions of American liberty.</p>

<p>Such isolated utterances showed a spreading sentiment. The honour of
the first victory in the practical application must be given to
Granville Sharp<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> (1735-1813), one of the most charming and, in the
best sense, 'Quixotic' of men. In 1772 his exertions had led to the
famous decision by Lord Mansfield in the case of the negro
Somerset.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Sharp in 1787 became chairman of the committee formed
to attack the slave-trade
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
by collecting the evidence of which
Wilberforce made use in parliament. The committee was chiefly composed
of Quakers; as indeed, Quakers are pretty sure to be found in every
philanthropic movement of the period. I must leave the explanation to
the historian of religious movements; but the fact is characteristic.
The Quakers had taken the lead in America. The Quaker was both
practical and a mystic. His principles put him outside of the ordinary
political interests, and of the military world. He directed his
activities to helping the poor, the prisoner, and the oppressed. Among
the Quakers of the eighteenth century were John Woolman (1720-1772), a
writer beloved by the congenial Charles Lamb and Antoine Benezet
(1713-1784), born in France, and son of a French refugee who settled
in Philadelphia. When Clarkson wrote the prize essay upon the
slave-trade (1785), which started his career, it was from Benezet's
writings that he obtained his information. By their influence the
Pennsylvanian Quakers were gradually led to pronounce against
slavery<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>; and the first anti-slavery society was founded in
Philadelphia in 1775, the year in which the skirmish at Lexington
began the war of independence. That suggests another influence. The
Rationalists of the eighteenth century were never tired of praising
the Quakers. The Quakers were, by their essential principles, in
favour of absolute toleration, and their attitude towards dogma was
not dissimilar. 'Rationalisation' and 'Spiritualisation' are in some
directions similar. The general spread of philanthropic sentiment,
which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
found its formula in the <i>Rights of Man</i>, fell in with the
Quaker hatred of war and slavery. Voltaire heartily admires Barclay,
the Quaker apologist. It is, therefore, not surprising to find the
names of the deists, Franklin and Paine, associated with Quakers in
this movement. Franklin was an early president of the new association,
and Paine wrote an article to support the early agitation.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Paine
himself was a Quaker by birth, who had dropped his early creed while
retaining a respect for its adherents. When the agitation began it was
in fact generally approved by all except the slave-traders. Sound Whig
divines, Watson and Paley and Parr; Unitarians such as Priestley and
Gilbert Wakefield and William Smith; and the great methodist, John
Wesley, were united on this point. Fox and Burke and Pitt rivalled
each other in condemning the system. The actual delay was caused
partly by the strength of the commercial interests in parliament, and
partly by the growth of the anti-Jacobin sentiment.</p>

<p>The attempt to monopolise the credit of the movement by any particular
sect is absurd. Wilberforce and his friends might fairly claim the
glory of having been worthy representatives of a new spirit of
philanthropy; but most certainly they did not create or originate it.
The general growth of that spirit throughout the century must be
explained, so far as 'explanation' is possible, by wider causes. It
was, as I must venture to assume, a product of complex social changes
which were bringing classes and nations into closer contact, binding
them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
together by new ties, and breaking up the old institutions which
had been formed under obsolete conditions. The true moving forces were
the same whether these representatives announced the new gospel of the
'rights of man'; or appealed to the traditional rights of Englishmen;
or rallied supporters of the old order so far as it still provided the
most efficient machinery for the purpose. The revival of religion
under Wesley and the Evangelicals meant the direction of the stream
into one channel. The paralytic condition of the Church of England
disqualified it for appropriating the new energy. The men who directed
the movements were mainly stimulated by moral indignation at the gross
abuses, and the indolence of the established priesthood naturally gave
them an anti-sacerdotal turn. They simply accepted the old Protestant
tradition. They took no interest in the intellectual questions
involved. Rationalism, according to them, meant simply an attack upon
the traditional sanctions of morality; and it scarcely occurred to
them to ask for any philosophical foundation of their creed.
Wilberforce's book, <i>A Practical View</i>, attained an immense
popularity, and is characteristic of the position. Wilberforce turns
over the infidel to be confuted by Paley, whom he takes to be a
conclusive reasoner. For himself he is content to show what needed
little proof, that the so-called Christians of the day could act as if
they had never heard of the New Testament. The Evangelical movement
had in short no distinct relation to speculative movements. It took
the old tradition for granted, and it need not here be further
considered.</p>

<p>One other remark is suggested by the agitation against the
slave-trade. It set a precedent for agitation of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
kind afterwards
familiar. The committee appealed to the country, and got up petitions.
Sound Tories complained of them in the early slave-trade debates, as
attempts to dictate to parliament by democratic methods. Political
agitators had formed associations, and found a convenient instrument
in the 'county meetings,' which seems to have possessed a kind of
indefinite legal character.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Such associations of course depend
for the great part of their influence upon the press. The circulation
of literature was one great object. Paine's <i>Rights of Man</i> was
distributed by the revolutionary party, and Hannah More wrote popular
tracts to persuade the poor that they had no grievances. It is said
that two millions of her little tracts, 'Village Politics by Will
Chip,' the 'Shepherd of Salisbury Plain,' and so forth were
circulated. The demand, indeed, showed rather the eagerness of the
rich to get them read than the eagerness of the poor to read them.
They failed to destroy Paine's influence, but they were successful
enough to lead to the foundation of the Religious Tract Society. The
attempt to influence the poor by cheap literature shows that these
opinions were beginning to demand consideration. Cobbett and many
others were soon to use the new weapon. Meanwhile the newspapers
circulated among the higher ranks were passing through a new phase,
which must be noted. The great newspapers were gaining power. The
<i>Morning Chronicle</i> was started by Woodfall in 1769, the <i>Morning
Post</i> and <i>Morning Herald</i> by Dudley Bate in 1772 and 1780, and the
<i>Times</i> by Walter in 1788. The modern editor was to appear during the
war. Stoddart and Barnes of the <i>Times</i>, Perry and Black of the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
were to become important politically. The
revolutionary period marks the transition from the old-fashioned
newspaper, carried on by a publisher and an author, to the modern
newspaper, which represents a kind of separate organism, elaborately
'differentiated' and worked by a whole army of co-operating editors,
correspondents, reporters, and contributors. Finally, one remark may
be made. The literary class in England was not generally opposed to
the governing classes. The tone of Johnson's whole circle was
conservative. In fact, since Harley's time, government had felt the
need of support in the press, and politicians on both sides had their
regular organs. The opposition might at any time become the
government; and their supporters in the press, poor men who were only
too dependent, had no motive for going beyond the doctrines of their
principals. They might be bought by opponents, or they might be
faithful to a patron. They did not form a band of outcasts, whose hand
would be against every one. The libel law was severe enough, but there
had been no licensing system since the early days of William and Mary.
A man could publish what he chose at his own peril. When the current
of popular feeling was anti-revolutionary, government might obtain a
conviction, but even in the worst times there was a chance that juries
might be restive. Editors had at times to go to prison, but even then
the paper was not suppressed. Cobbett, for example, continued to
publish his <i>Registrar</i> during an imprisonment of two years (1810-12).
Editors had very serious anxieties, but they could express with
freedom any opinion which had the support of a party. English liberty
was so far a reality that a very free discussion of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the political
problems of the day was permitted and practised. The English author,
therefore, as such, had not the bitterness of a French man of letters,
unless, indeed, he had the misfortune to be an uncompromising
revolutionist.</p>

<p class="scs">V. <a name="III_V" id="III_V"></a>THE FRENCH REVOLUTION</p>

<p>The English society which I have endeavoured to characterise was now
to be thrown into the vortex of the revolutionary wars. The surpassing
dramatic interest of the French Revolution has tended to obscure our
perception of the continuity of even English history. It has been easy
to ascribe to the contagion of French example political movements
which were already beginning in England and which were modified rather
than materially altered by our share in the great European convulsion.
The impression made upon Englishmen by the French Revolution is,
however, in the highest degree characteristic. The most vehement
sympathies and antipathies were aroused, and showed at least what
principles were congenial to the various English parties. To praise or
blame the revolution, as if it could be called simply good or bad, is
for the historian as absurd as to praise or blame an earthquake. It
was simply inevitable under the conditions. We may, of course, take it
as an essential stage in a social evolution, which if described as
progress is therefore to be blessed, or if as degeneration may provoke
lamentation. We may, if we please, ask whether superior statesmanship
might have attained the good results without the violent catastrophes,
or whether a wise and good man who could appreciate the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
real position
would have approved or condemned the actual policy. But to answer such
problems with any confidence would imply a claim to a
quasi-omniscience. Partisans at the time, however, answered them
without hesitation, and saw in the Revolution the dawn of a new era of
reason and justice, or the outburst of the fires of hell. Their view
is at any rate indicative of their own position. The extreme opinions
need no exposition. They are represented by the controversy between
Burke and Paine. The general doctrine of the 'Rights of Men'&mdash;that all
men are by nature free and equal&mdash;covered at least the doctrine that
the inequality and despotism of the existing order was hateful, and
people with a taste for abstract principles accepted this short cut to
political wisdom. The 'minor' premise being obviously true, they took
the major for granted. To Burke, who idealised the traditional element
in the British Constitution, and so attached an excessive importance
to historical continuity, the new doctrine seemed to imply the
breaking up of the very foundations of order and the pulverisation of
society. Burke and Paine both assumed too easily that the dogmas which
they defended expressed the real and ultimate beliefs, and that the
belief was the cause, not the consequence, of the political condition.
Without touching upon the logic of either position, I may notice how
the problem presented itself to the average English politician whose
position implied acceptance of traditional compromises and who yet
prided himself on possessing the liberties which were now being
claimed by Frenchmen. The Whig could heartily sympathise with the
French Revolution so long as it appeared to be an attempt to
assimilate British principles.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
When Fox hailed the fall of the
Bastille as the greatest and best event that had ever happened, he was
expressing a generous enthusiasm shared by all the ardent and
enlightened youth of the time. The French, it seemed, were abolishing
an arbitrary despotism and adopting the principles of Magna Charta and
the 'Habeas Corpus' Act. Difficulties, however, already suggested
themselves to the true Whig. Would the French, as Young asked just
after the same event, 'copy the constitution of England, freed from
its faults, or attempt, from theory, to frame something absolutely
speculative'?<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> On that issue depended the future of the country.
It was soon decided in the sense opposed to Young's wishes. The reign
of terror alienated the average Whig. But though the argument from
atrocities is the popular one, the opposition was really more
fundamental. Burke put the case, savagely and coarsely enough, in his
'Letter to a noble Lord.' How would the duke of Bedford like to be
treated as the revolutionists were treating the nobility in France?
The duke might be a sincere lover of political liberty, but he
certainly would not be prepared to approve the confiscation of his
estates. The aristocratic Whigs, dependent for their whole property
and for every privilege which they prized upon ancient tradition and
prescription, could not really be in favour of sweeping away the whole
complex social structure, levelling Windsor Castle as Burke put it in
his famous metaphor, and making a 'Bedford level' of the whole
country. The Whigs had to disavow any approval of the Jacobins;
Mackintosh, who had given his answer to Burke's diatribes, met Burke
himself on friendly terms (9th July
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
1797), and in 1800 took an
opportunity of public recantation. He only expressed the natural
awakening of the genuine Whig to the aspects of the case which he had
hitherto ignored. The effect upon the middle-class Whigs is, however,
more to my purpose. It may be illustrated by the history of John Horne
Tooke<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> (1736-1812), who at this time represented what may be
called the home-bred British radicalism. He was the son of a London
tradesman, who had distinguished himself by establishing, and
afterwards declining to enforce, certain legal rights against
Frederick Prince of Wales. The prince recognised the tradesman's
generosity by making his antagonist purveyor to his household. A debt
of some thousand pounds was thus run up before the prince's death
which was never discharged. Possibly the son's hostility to the royal
family was edged by this circumstance. John Horne, forced to take
orders in order to hold a living, soon showed himself to have been
intended by nature for the law. He took up the cause of Wilkes in the
early part of the reign; defended him energetically in later years;
and in 1769 helped to start the 'Society for supporting the Bill of
Rights.' He then attacked Wilkes, who, as he maintained, misapplied
for his own private use the funds subscribed for public purposes to
this society; and set up a rival 'Constitutional Society.' In 1775, as
spokesman of this body, he denounced the 'king's troops' for
'inhumanly murdering' their fellow-subjects at Lexington for the sole
crime of 'preferring death to slavery.' He was imprisoned for the
libel, and thus became a martyr to the cause. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the country
associations were formed in 1780 to protest against the abuses
revealed by the war, Horne became a member of the 'Society for
Constitutional Information,' of which Major Cartwright&mdash;afterwards the
revered, but rather tiresome, patriarch of the Radicals&mdash;was called
the 'father.' Horne Tooke (as he was now named), by these and other
exhibitions of boundless pugnacity, became a leader among the
middle-class Whigs, who found their main support among London
citizens, such as Beckford, Troutbeck and Oliver; supported them in
his later days; and after the American war, preferred Pitt, as an
advocate of parliamentary reform, to Fox, the favourite of the
aristocratic Whigs. He denounced the Fox coalition ministry, and in
later years opposed Fox at Westminster. The 'Society for
Constitutional Information' was still extant in the revolutionary
period, and Tooke, a bluff, jovial companion, who had by this time got
rid of his clerical character, often took the chair at the taverns
where they met to talk sound politics over their port. The revolution
infused new spirit into politics. In March 1791<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Tooke's society
passed a vote of thanks to Paine for the first part of his <i>Rights of
Man</i>. Next year Thomas Hardy, a radical shoemaker, started a
'Corresponding Society.' Others sprang up throughout the country,
especially in the manufacturing towns.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> These societies took Paine
for their oracle, and circulated his writings as their manifesto. They
communicated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
occasionally with Horne Tooke's society, which more or
less sympathised with them. The Whigs of the upper sphere started the
'Friends of the People' in April 1792, in order to direct the
discontent into safer channels. Grey, Sheridan and Erskine were
members; Fox sympathised but declined to join; Mackintosh was
secretary; and Sir Philip Francis drew up the opening address, citing
the authority of Pitt and Blackstone, and declaring that the society
wished 'not to change but to restore.'<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> It remonstrated cautiously
with the other societies, and only excited their distrust. Grey, as
its representative, made a motion for parliamentary reform which was
rejected (May 1793) by two hundred and eighty-two to forty-one. Later
motions in May 1797 and April 1800 showed that, for the present,
parliamentary reform was out of the question. Meanwhile the English
Jacobins got up a 'convention' which met at Edinburgh at the end of
1793. The very name was alarming: the leaders were tried and
transported; the cruelty of the sentences and the severity of the
judges, especially Braxfield, shocked such men as Parr and Jeffrey,
and unsuccessful appeals for mercy were made in parliament. The Habeas
Corpus Act was suspended in 1794: Horne Tooke and Hardy were both
arrested and tried for high treason in November. An English jury
fortunately showed itself less subservient than the Scottish; the
judge was scrupulously fair: and both Hardy and Horne Tooke were
acquitted. The societies, however, though they were encouraged for a
time, were attacked by severe measures passed by Pitt in 1795. The
'Friends of the People' ceased to exist The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
seizure of the committee
of the Corresponding Societies in 1798 put an end to their activity. A
report presented to parliament in 1799<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> declares that the
societies had gone to dangerous lengths: they had communicated with
the French revolutionists and with the 'United Irishmen' (founded
1791); and societies of 'United Englishmen' and 'United Scotsmen' had
had some concern in the mutinies of the fleet in 1797 and in the Irish
rebellion of 1798. Place says, probably with truth, that the danger
was much exaggerated: but in any case, an act for the suppression of
the Corresponding Societies was passed in 1799, and put an end to the
movement.</p>

<p>This summary is significant of the state of opinion. The genuine
old-fashioned Whig dreaded revolution, and guarded himself carefully
against any appearance of complicity. Jacobinism, on the other hand,
was always an exotic. Such men as the leading Nonconformists Priestley
and Price were familiar with the speculative movement on the
continent, and sympathised with the enlightenment. Young men of
genius, like Wordsworth and Coleridge, imbibed the same doctrines more
or less thoroughly, and took Godwin for their English representative.
The same creed was accepted by the artisans in the growing towns, from
whom the Corresponding Societies drew their recruits. But the
revolutionary sentiment was not so widely spread as its adherents
hoped or its enemies feared. The Birmingham mob of 1791 acted, with a
certain unconscious humour, on the side of church and king. They had
perhaps an instinctive perception that it was an advantage to plunder
on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the side of the constable. In fact, however, the general feeling
in all classes was anti-Jacobin. Place, an excellent witness, himself
a member of the Corresponding Societies, declares that the repressive
measures were generally popular even among the workmen.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> They were
certainly not penetrated with revolutionary fervour. Had it been
otherwise, the repressive measures, severe as they were, would have
stimulated rather than suppressed the societies, and, instead of
silencing the revolutionists, have provoked a rising.</p>

<p>At the early period the Jacobin and the home-bred Radical might
combine against government. A manifesto of the Corresponding Societies
begins by declaring that 'all men are by nature free and equal and
independent of each other,' and argues also that these are the
'original principles of English government.'<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Magna Charta is an
early expression of the Declaration of Rights, and thus pure reason
confirms British tradition. The adoption of a common platform,
however, covered a profound difference of sentiment. Horne Tooke
represents the old type of reformer. He was fully resolved not to be
carried away by the enthusiasm of his allies. 'My companions in a
stage,' he said to Cartwright, 'may be going to Windsor: I will go
with them to Hounslow. But there I will get out: no further will I go,
by God!'<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> When Sheridan supported a vote of sympathy for the
French revolutionists, Tooke insisted upon adding a rider declaring
the content of Englishmen with their own constitution.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> He
offended some of his allies by asserting that the 'main timbers' of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the constitution were sound though the dry-rot had got into the
superstructure. He maintained, according to Godwin,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> that the best
of all governments had been that of England under George <small>I.</small> Though
Cartwright said at the trial that Horne Tooke was taken to 'have no
religion whatever,' he was, according to Stephens, 'a great stickler
for the church of England': and stood up for the House of Lords as
well as the church on grounds of utility.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> He always ridiculed
Paine and the doctrine of abstract rights,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and told Cartwright
that though all men had an equal right to a share of property, they
had not a right to an equal share. Horne Tooke's Radicalism (I use the
word by anticipation) was that of the sturdy tradesman. He opposed the
government because he hated war, taxation and sinecures. He argued
against universal suffrage with equal pertinacity. A comfortable old
gentleman, with a good cellar of Madeira, and proud of his wall-fruit
in a well-tilled garden, had no desire to see George <small>III</small>. at the
guillotine, and still less to see a mob supreme in Lombard Street or
banknotes superseded by assignats. He might be jealous of the great
nobles, but he dreaded mob-rule. He could denounce abuses, but he
could not desire anarchy. He is said to have retorted upon some one
who had boasted that English courts of justice were open to all
classes: 'So is the London tavern&mdash;to all who can pay.'<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> That is
in the spirit of Bentham; and yet Bentham complains that Horne Tooke's
disciple, Burdett, believed in the common law, and revered the
authority of Coke.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
brief, the creed of Horne Tooke meant
'liberty' founded upon tradition. I shall presently notice the
consistency of this with what may be called his philosophy. Meanwhile
it was only natural that radicals of this variety should retire from
active politics, having sufficiently burnt their fingers by flirtation
with the more thoroughgoing party. How they came to life again will
appear hereafter. Horne Tooke himself took warning from his narrow
escape. He stayed quietly in his house at Wimbledon.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> There he
divided his time between his books and his garden, and received his
friends to Sunday dinners. Bentham, Mackintosh, Coleridge, and Godwin
were among his visitors. Coleridge calls him a 'keen iron man,' and
reports that he made a butt of Godwin as he had done of Paine.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
Porson and Boswell encountered him in drinking matches and were both
left under the table.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The house was thus a small centre of
intellectual life, though the symposia were not altogether such as
became philosophers. Horne Tooke was a keen and shrewd disputant, well
able to impress weaker natures. His neighbour, Sir Francis Burdett,
became his political disciple, and in later years was accepted as the
radical leader. Tooke died at Wimbledon 18th March 1812.</p>

<p class="scs"><a name="III_VI" id="III_VI"></a>VI. INDIVIDUALISM</p>

<p>The general tendencies which I have so far tried to indicate will have
to be frequently noticed in the course of the following pages. One
point may be emphasised before proceeding: a main characteristic of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the whole social and political order is what is now called its
'individualism.' That phrase is generally supposed to convey some
censure. It may connote, however, some of the most essential virtues
that a race can possess. Energy, self-reliance, and independence, a
strong conviction that a man's fate should depend upon his own
character and conduct, are qualities without which no nation can be
great. They are the conditions of its vital power. They were
manifested in a high degree by the Englishmen of the eighteenth
century. How far they were due to the inherited qualities of the race,
to the political or social history, or to external circumstances, I
need not ask. They were the qualities which had especially impressed
foreign observers. The fierce, proud, intractable Briton was elbowing
his way to a high place in the world, and showing a vigour not always
amiable, but destined to bring him successfully through tremendous
struggles. In the earlier part of the century, Voltaire and French
philosophers admired English freedom of thought and free speech, even
when it led to eccentricity and brutality of manners, and to barbarism
in matters of taste. Englishmen, conscious and proud of their
'liberty,' were the models of all who desired liberty for themselves.
Liberty, as they understood it, involved, among other things, an
assault upon the old restrictive system, which at every turn hampered
the rising industrial energy. This is the sense in which
'Individualism,' or the gospel according to Adam Smith&mdash;<i>laissez
faire</i>, and so forth&mdash;has been specially denounced in recent times.
Without asking at present how far such attacks are justifiable, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
must be content to assume that the old restrictive system was in its
actual form mischievous, guided by entirely false theories, and the
great barrier to the development of industry. The same spirit appeared
in purely political questions. 'Liberty,' as is often remarked, may be
interpreted in two ways; not necessarily consistent with each other.
It means sometimes simply the diminution of the sphere of law and the
power of legislators, or, again, the transference to subjects of the
power of legislating, and, therefore, not less control, but control by
self-made laws alone. The Englishman, who was in presence of no
centralised administrative power, who regarded the Government rather
as receiving power from individuals than as delegating the power of a
central body, took liberty mainly in the sense of restricting law.
Government in general was a nuisance, though a necessity; and properly
employed only in mediating between conflicting interests, and
restraining the violence of individuals forced into contact by outward
circumstances. When he demanded that a greater share of influence
should be given to the people, he always took for granted that their
power would be used to diminish the activity of the sovereign power;
that there would be less government and therefore less jobbery, less
interference with free speech and free action, and smaller perquisites
to be bestowed in return for the necessary services. The people would
use their authority to tie the hands of the rulers, and limit them
strictly to their proper and narrow functions.</p>

<p>The absence, again, of the idea of a state in any other sense implies
another tendency. The 'idea' was not required. Englishmen were
concerned rather with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
details than with first principles. Satisfied,
in a general way, with their constitution, they did not want to be
bothered with theories. Abstract and absolute doctrines of right, when
imported from France, fell flat upon the average Englishman. He was
eager enough to discuss the utility of this or that part of the
machinery, but without inquiring into first principles of mechanism.
The argument from 'utility' deals with concrete facts, and presupposes
an acceptance of some common criterion of the useful. The constant
discussion of political matters in parliament and the press implied a
tacit acceptance on all hands of constitutional methods. Practical
men, asking whether this or that policy shall be adopted in view of
actual events, no more want to go back to right reason and 'laws of
nature' than a surveyor to investigate the nature of geometrical
demonstration. Very important questions were raised as to the rights
of the press, for example, or the system of representation. But
everybody agreed that the representative system and freedom of speech
were good things; and argued the immediate questions of fact. The
order, only established by experience and tradition, was accepted,
subject to criticism of detail, and men turned impatiently from
abstract argument, and left the inquiry into 'social contracts' to
philosophers, that is, to silly people in libraries. Politics were
properly a matter of business, to be discussed in a business-like
spirit. In this sense, 'individualism' is congenial to 'empiricism,'
because it starts from facts and particular interests, and resents the
intrusion of first principles.</p>

<p>The characteristic individualism, again, suggests one other remark.
Individual energy and sense of responsibility
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
are good&mdash;as even
extreme socialists may admit&mdash;if they do not exclude a sense of duties
to others. It may be a question how far the stimulation of individual
enterprise and the vigorous spirit of industrial competition really
led to a disregard of the interests of the weaker. But it would be a
complete misunderstanding of the time if we inferred that it meant a
decline of humane feeling. Undoubtedly great evils had grown up, and
some continued to grow which were tolerated by the indifference, or
even stimulated by the selfish aims, of the dominant classes. But, in
the first place, many of the most active prophets of the individualist
spirit were acting, and acting sincerely, in the name of humanity.
They were attacking a system which they held, and to a great extent, I
believe, held rightly, to be especially injurious to the weakest
classes. Possibly they expected too much from the simple removal of
restrictions; but certainly they denounced the restrictions as unjust
to all, not simply as hindrances to the wealth of the rich. Adam
Smith's position is intelligible: it was, he thought, a proof of a
providential order that each man, by helping himself, unintentionally
helped his neighbours. The moral sense based upon sympathy was
therefore not opposed to, but justified, the economic principles that
each man should first attend to his own interest. The unintentional
co-operation would thus become conscious and compatible with the
established order. And, in the next place, so far from there being a
want of humane feeling, the most marked characteristic of the
eighteenth century was precisely the growth of humanity. In the next
generation, the eighteenth century came to be denounced as cold,
heartless, faithless, and so forth.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
The established mode of writing
history is partly responsible for this perversion. Men speak as though
some great man, who first called attention to an evil, was a
supernatural being who had suddenly dropped into the world from
another sphere. His condemnation of evil is therefore taken to be a
proof that the time must be evil. Any century is bad if we assume all
the good men to be exceptions. But the great man is really also the
product of his time. He is the mouthpiece of its prevailing
sentiments, and only the first to see clearly what many are beginning
to perceive obscurely. The emergence of the prophet is a proof of the
growing demand of his hearers for sound teaching. Because he is in
advance of men generally, he sees existing abuses more clearly, and we
take his evidence against his contemporaries as conclusive. But the
fact that they listened shows how widely the same sensibility to evil
was already diffused. In fact, as I think, the humane spirit of the
eighteenth century, due to the vast variety of causes which we call
social progress or evolution&mdash;not to the teaching of any
individual&mdash;was permeating the whole civilised world, and showed
itself in the philosophic movement as well as in the teaching of the
religious leaders, who took the philosophers to be their enemies. I
have briefly noticed the various philanthropic movements which were
characteristic of the period. Some of them may indicate the growth of
new evils; others, that evils which had once been regarded with
indifference were now attracting attention and exciting indignation.
But even the growth of new evils does not show general indifference so
much as the incapacity of the existing system to deal with new
conditions. It may, I think,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
be safely said that a growing
philanthropy was characteristic of the whole period, and in particular
animated the Utilitarian movement, as I shall have to show in detail.
Modern writers have often spoken of the Wesleyan propaganda and the
contemporary 'evangelical revival' as the most important movements of
the time. They are apt to speak, in conformity with the view just
described, as though Wesley or some of his contemporaries had
originated or created the better spirit. Without asking what was good
or bad in some aspects of these movements, I fully believe that Wesley
was essentially a moral reformer, and that he deserves corresponding
respect. But instead of holding that his contemporaries were bad
people, awakened by a stimulus from without, I hold that the movement,
so far as really indicating moral improvement, must be set down to the
credit of the century itself. It was one manifestation of a general
progress, of which Bentham was another outcome. Though Bentham might
have thought Wesley a fanatic or perhaps a hypocrite, and Wesley would
certainly have considered that Bentham's heart was much in need of a
change, they were really allies as much as antagonists, and both mark
a great and beneficial change.

<h3>PHILOSOPHY</h3>

<p class="scs">I. <a name="IV_I" id="IV_I"></a>JOHN HORNE TOOKE</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
I have so far dwelt upon the social and political environment of the
early Utilitarian movement; and have tried also to point out some of
the speculative tendencies fostered by the position. If it be asked
what philosophical doctrines were explicitly taught, the answer must
be a very short one. English philosophy barely existed. Parr was
supposed to know something about metaphysics&mdash;apparently because he
could write good Latin. But the inference was hasty. Of one book,
however, which had a real influence, I must say something, for though
it contained little definite philosophy, it showed what kind of
philosophy was congenial to the common sense of the time.</p>

<p>The sturdy radical, Horne Tooke, had been led to the study of
philology by a characteristic incident. The legal question had arisen
whether the words, '<i>She, knowing that Crooke had been indicted for
forgery</i>,' did so and so, contained an averment that Crooke had been
indicted. Tooke argued in a letter to Dunning<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
they did;
because they were equivalent to the phrase, 'Crooke had been indicted
for forgery: she, <i>knowing that</i>,' did so and so. This raises the
question: What is the meaning of 'that'? Tooke took up the study,
thinking, as he says, that it would throw light upon some
philosophical questions. He learned some Anglo-Saxon and Gothic to
test his theory and, of course, confirmed it.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The book shows
ingenuity, shrewdness, and industry, and Tooke deserves credit for
seeing the necessity of applying a really historical method to his
problem, though his results were necessarily crude in the
pre-scientific stage of philology.</p>

<p>The book is mainly a long string of etymologies, which readers of
different tastes have found intolerably dull or an amusing collection
of curiosities. Tooke held, and surely with reason, that an
investigation of language, the great instrument of thought, may help
to throw light upon the process of thinking. He professes to be a
disciple of Locke in philosophy as in politics. Locke, he said,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
made a lucky mistake in calling his book an essay upon human
understanding; for he thus attracted many who would have been repelled
had he called it what it really was, 'a treatise upon words and
language.' According to Tooke, in fact,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> what we call 'operations
of mind' are only 'operations of language.' The mind contemplates
nothing but 'impressions,' that is, 'sensations or feelings,' which
Locke called 'ideas,' Locke
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
mistook composition of terms for
composition of ideas. To compound ideas is impossible. We can only use
one term as a sign of many ideas. Locke, again, supposed that
affirming and denying were operations of the mind, whereas they are
only artifices of language.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The mind, then, can only contemplate, separately or together,
aggregates of 'ideas,' ultimate atoms, incapable of being parted or
dissolved. There are, therefore, only two classes of words, nouns and
verbs; all others, prepositions, conjunctions, and so forth, being
abbreviations, a kind of mental shorthand to save the trouble of
enumerating the separate items. Tooke, in short, is a thoroughgoing
nominalist. The realities, according to him, are sticks, stones, and
material objects, or the 'ideas' which 'represent' them. They can be
stuck together or taken apart, but all the words which express
relations, categories, and the like, are in themselves meaningless.
The special objects of his scorn are 'Hermes' Harris, and Monboddo,
who had tried to defend Aristotle against Locke. Monboddo had asserted
that 'every kind of relation' is a pure 'idea of the intellect' not to
be apprehended by sense.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> If so, according to Tooke, it would be a
nonentity.</p>

<p>This doctrine gives a short cut to the abolition of metaphysics. The
word 'metaphysics,' says Tooke,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> is nonsense. All metaphysical
controversies are 'founded on the grossest ignorance of words and the
nature of speech.' The greatest part of his second volume is concerned
with etymologies intended to prove that an 'abstract idea' is a mere
word. Abstract words, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
says,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> are generally 'participles
without a substantive and therefore in construction used as
substantives.' From a misunderstanding of this has arisen
'metaphysical jargon' and 'false morality.' In illustration he gives a
singular list of words, including 'fate, chance, heaven, hell,
providence, prudence, innocence, substance, fiend, angel, apostle,
spirit, true, false, desert, merit, faith, etc., all of which are mere
participles poetically embodied and substantiated by those who use
them.' A couple of specific applications, often quoted by later
writers, will sufficiently indicate his drift.</p>

<p>Such words, he remarks,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> as 'right' and 'just' mean simply that
which is ordered or commanded. The chapter is headed 'rights of man,'
and Tooke's interlocutor naturally observes that this is a singular
result for a democrat. Man, it would seem, has no rights except the
rights created by the law. Tooke admits the inference to be correct,
but replies that the democrat in disobeying human law may be obeying
the law of God, and is obeying the law of God when he obeys the law of
nature. The interlocutor does not inquire what Tooke could mean by the
'law of nature.' We can guess what Tooke would have said to Paine in
the Wimbledon garden. In fact, however, Tooke is here, as elsewhere,
following Hobbes, though, it seems, unconsciously. Another famous
etymology is that of 'truth' from 'troweth.'<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Truth is what each
man thinks. There is no such thing, therefore, as 'eternal, immutable,
everlasting truth, unless mankind, <i>such as they are at present</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> be
eternal, immutable, everlasting.' Two persons may contradict each
other and yet each may be speaking what is true for him. Truth may be
a vice as well as a virtue; for on many occasions it is wrong to speak
the truth.</p>

<p>These phrases may possibly be interpreted in a sense less paradoxical
than the obvious one. Tooke's philosophy, if so it is to be called,
was never fully expounded. He burned his papers before his death, and
we do not know what he would have said about 'verbs,' which must have
led, one would suppose, to some further treatment of relations, nor
upon the subject, which as Stephens tells us, was most fully treated
in his continuation, the value of human testimony.</p>

<p>If Tooke was not a philosopher he was a man of remarkably shrewd
cynical common sense, who thought philosophy idle foppery. His book
made a great success. Stephens tells us<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> that it brought him &pound;4000
or &pound;5000. Hazlitt in 1810 published a grammar professing to
incorporate for the first time Horne Tooke's 'discoveries.' The book
was admired by Mackintosh,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> who, of course, did not accept the
principles, and had a warm disciple in Charles Richardson (1775-1865),
who wrote in its defence against Dugald Stewart and accepted its
authority in his elaborate dictionary of the English language.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
But its chief interest for us is that it was a great authority with
James Mill. Mill accepts the etymologies, and there is much in common
between the two writers, though Mill had learned his main
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> doctrines
elsewhere, especially from Hobbes. What the agreement really shows is
how the intellectual idiosyncrasy which is congenial to 'nominalism'
in philosophy was also congenial to Tooke's matter of fact radicalism
and to the Utilitarian position of Bentham and his followers.</p>

<p class="scs">II. <a name="IV_II" id="IV_II"></a>DUGALD STEWART</p>

<p>If English philosophy was a blank, there was still a leader of high
reputation in Scotland. Dugald Stewart (1753-1828) had a considerable
influence upon the Utilitarians. He represented, on the one hand, the
doctrines which they thought themselves specially bound to attack, and
it may perhaps be held that in some ways he betrayed to them the key
of the position. Stewart<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> was son of a professor of mathematics at
Edinburgh. He studied at Glasgow (1771-72) where he became Reid's
favourite pupil and devoted friend. In 1772 he became the assistant,
and in 1775 the colleague, of his father, and he appears to have had a
considerable knowledge of mathematics. In 1785 he succeeded Adam
Ferguson as professor of moral philosophy and lectured continuously
until 1810. He then gave up his active duties to Thomas Brown,
devoting himself to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
completion and publication of the substance
of his lectures. Upon Brown's death in 1820, he resigned a post to
which he was no longer equal. A paralytic stroke in 1822 weakened him,
though he was still able to write. He died in 1828.</p>

<p>If Stewart now makes no great mark in histories of philosophy, his
personal influence was conspicuous. Cockburn describes him as of
delicate appearance, with a massive head, bushy eyebrows, gray
intelligent eyes, flexible mouth and expressive countenance. His voice
was sweet and his ear exquisite. Cockburn never heard a better reader,
and his manners, though rather formal, were graceful and dignified.
James Mill, after hearing Pitt and Fox, declared that Stewart was
their superior in eloquence. At Edinburgh, then at the height of its
intellectual activity, he held his own among the ablest men and
attracted the loyalty of the younger. Students came not only from
Scotland but from England, the United States, France and Germany.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
Scott won the professor's approval by an essay on the 'Customs of the
Northern Nations.' Jeffrey, Horner, Cockburn and Mackintosh were among
his disciples. His lectures upon Political Economy were attended by
Sydney Smith, Jeffrey and Brougham, and one of his last hearers was
Lord Palmerston. Parr looked up to him as a great philosopher, and
contributed to his works an essay upon the etymology of the word
'sublime,' too vast to be printed whole. Stewart was an upholder of
Whig principles, when the Scottish government was in the hands of the
staunchest Tories. The irreverent young Edinburgh Reviewers treated
him with respect, and to some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
extent applied his theory to politics.
Stewart was the philosophical heir of Reid; and, one may say, was a
Whig both in philosophy and in politics. He was a rationalist, but
within the limits fixed by respectability; and he dreaded the
revolution in politics, and believed in the surpassing merits of the
British Constitution as interpreted by the respectable Whigs.</p>

<p>Stewart represents the 'common sense' doctrine. That name, as he
observes, lends itself to an equivocation. Common sense is generally
used as nearly synonymous with 'mother wit,' the average opinion of
fairly intelligent men; and he would prefer to speak of the
'fundamental laws of belief.'<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> There can, however, be no doubt
that the doctrine derived much of its strength from the apparent
confirmation of the 'average opinion' by the 'fundamental laws.' On
one side, said Reid, are all the vulgar; on the other all the
philosophers. 'In this division, to my great humiliation, I find
myself classed with the vulgar.'<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Reid, in fact, had opposed the
theories of Hume and Berkeley because they led to a paradoxical
scepticism. If it be, as Reid held, a legitimate inference from
Berkeley that a man may as well run his head against a post, there can
be no doubt that it is shocking to common sense in every acceptation
of the word. The reasons, however, which Reid and Stewart alleged for
not performing that feat took a special form, which I am compelled to
notice briefly because they set up the mark for the whole intellectual
artillery of the Utilitarians. Reid, in fact, invented what J. S. Mill
called 'intuitions.' To confute intuitionists and get rid of
intuitions was one main purpose of all Mill's speculations.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
What,
then, is an 'intuition'? To explain that fully it would be necessary
to write once more that history of the philosophical movement from
Descartes to Hume, which has been summarised and elucidated by so many
writers that it should be as plain as the road from St. Paul's to
Temple Bar. I am forced to glance at the position taken by Reid and
Stewart because it has a most important bearing upon the whole
Utilitarian scheme. Reid's main service to philosophy was, in his own
opinion,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> that he refuted the 'ideal system' of Descartes and his
followers. That system, he says, carried in its womb the monster,
scepticism, which came to the birth in 1739,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> the date of Hume's
early <i>Treatise</i>. To confute Hume, therefore, which was Reid's primary
object, it was necessary to go back to Descartes, and to show where he
deviated from the right track. In other words, we must trace the
genealogy of 'ideas.' Descartes, as Reid admitted, had rendered
immense services to philosophy. He had exploded the scholastic system,
which had become a mere mass of logomachies and an incubus upon
scientific progress. He had again been the first to 'draw a distinct
line between the material and the intellectual world'<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>; and Reid
apparently assumes that he had drawn it correctly. One characteristic
of the Cartesian school is obvious. Descartes, a great mathematician
at the period when mathematical investigations were showing their
enormous power, invented a mathematical universe. Mathematics
presented the true type of scientific reasoning and determined his
canons of inquiry. The 'essence' of matter, he said, was space. The
objective world, as we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
have learned to call it, is simply space
solidified or incarnate geometry. Its properties therefore could be
given as a system of deductions from first principles, and it forms a
coherent and self-subsistent whole. Meanwhile the essence of the soul
is thought. Thought and matter are absolutely opposed. They are
contraries, having nothing in common. Reality, however, seems to
belong to the world of space. The brain, too, belongs to that world,
and motions in the brain must be determined as a part of the material
mechanism. In some way or other 'ideas' correspond to these motions;
though to define the way tried all the ingenuity of Descartes'
successors. In any case an idea is 'subjective': it is a thought, not
a thing. It is a shifting, ephemeral entity not to be fixed or
grasped. Yet, somehow or other, it exists, and it 'represents'
realities; though the divine power has to be called in to guarantee
the accuracy of the representation. The objective world, again, does
not reveal itself to us as simply made up of 'primary qualities'; we
know of it only as somehow endowed with 'secondary' or sense-given
qualities: as visible, tangible, audible, and so forth. These
qualities are plainly 'subjective'; they vary from man to man, and
from moment to moment: they cannot be measured or fixed; and must be
regarded as a product in some inexplicable way of the action of matter
upon mind; unreal or, at any rate, not independent entities.</p>

<p>In Locke's philosophy, the 'ideas,' legitimate or illegitimate
descendants of the Cartesian theories, play a most prominent part.
Locke's admirable common sense made him the leader who embodied a
growing tendency. The empirical sciences were growing; and Locke, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
student of medicine, could note the fallacies which arise from
neglecting observation and experiment, and attempting to penetrate to
the absolute essences and entities. Newton's great success was due to
neglecting impossible problems about the nature of force in
itself&mdash;'action at a distance' and so forth&mdash;and attention to the
sphere of visible phenomena. The excessive pretensions of the framers
of metaphysical systems had led to hopeless puzzles and merely verbal
solutions. Locke, therefore, insisted upon the necessity of
ascertaining the necessary limits of human knowledge. All our
knowledge of material facts is obviously dependent in some way upon
our sensations&mdash;however fleeting or unreal they may be. Therefore, the
material sciences must depend upon sense-given data or upon
observation and experiment. Hume gives the ultimate purpose, already
implied in Locke's essay, when he describes his first treatise (on the
title page) as an 'attempt to introduce the experimental mode of
reasoning into moral subjects.' Now, as Reid thinks, the effect of
this was to construct our whole knowledge out of the representative
ideas. The empirical factor is so emphasised that we lose all grasp of
the real world. Locke, indeed, though he insists upon the derivation
of our whole knowledge from 'ideas,' leaves reality to the 'primary
qualities' without clearly expounding their relation to the secondary.
But Berkeley, alarmed by the tendency of the Cartesian doctrines to
materialism and mechanical necessity, reduces the 'primary' to the
level of the 'secondary,' and proceeds to abolish the whole world of
matter. We are thus left with nothing but 'ideas,' and the ideas are
naturally 'subjective' and therefore in some sense unreal.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> Finally
Hume gets rid of the soul as well as the outside world; and then, by
his theory of 'causation,' shows that the ideas themselves are
independent atoms, cohering but not rationally connected, and capable
of being arbitrarily joined or separated in any way whatever. Thus the
ideas have ousted the facts. We cannot get beyond ideas, and yet ideas
are still purely subjective. The 'real' is separated from the
phenomenal, and truth divorced from fact. The sense-given world is the
whole world, and yet is a world of mere accidental conjunctions and
separation. That is Hume's scepticism, and yet according to Reid is
the legitimate development of Descartes' 'ideal system.' Reid, I take
it, was right in seeing that there was a great dilemma. What was
required to escape from it? According to Kant, nothing less than a
revision of Descartes' mode of demarcation between object and subject.
The 'primary qualities' do not correspond in this way to an objective
world radically opposed to the subjective. Space is not a form of
things, but a form imposed upon the data of experience by the mind
itself. This, as Kant says, supposes a revolution in philosophy
comparable to the revolution made by Copernicus in astronomy. We have
completely to invert our whole system of conceiving the world.
Whatever the value of Kant's doctrine, of which I need here say
nothing, it was undoubtedly more prolific than Reid's. Reid's was far
less thoroughgoing. He does not draw a new line between object and
subject, but simply endeavours to show that the dilemma was due to
certain assumptions about the nature of 'ideas.'</p>

<p>The real had been altogether separated from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
phenomenal, or truth
divorced from fact. You can only have demonstrations by getting into a
region beyond the sensible world; while within that world&mdash;that is,
the region of ordinary knowledge and conduct&mdash;you are doomed to
hopeless uncertainty. An escape, therefore, must be sought by some
thorough revision of the assumed relation, but not by falling back
upon the exploded philosophy of the schools. Reid and his successors
were quite as much alive as Locke to the danger of falling into mere
scholastic logomachy. They, too, will in some sense base all knowledge
upon experience. Reid constantly appeals to the authority of Bacon,
whom he regards as the true founder of inductive science. The great
success of Bacon's method in the physical sciences, encouraged the
hope, already expressed by Newton, that a similar result might be
achieved in 'moral philosophy.'<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Hume had done something to clear
the way, but Reid was, as Stewart thinks, the first to perceive
clearly and justly the 'analogy between these two different branches
of human knowledge.' The mind and matter are two co-ordinate things,
whose properties are to be investigated by similar methods. Philosophy
thus means essentially psychology. The two inquiries are two
'branches' of inductive science, and the problem is to discover by a
perfectly impartial examination what are the 'fundamental laws of
mind' revealed by an accurate analysis of the various processes of
thought. The main result of Reid's investigations is given most
pointedly in his early <i>Inquiry</i>, and was fully accepted by Stewart.
Briefly it comes to this. No one can doubt that we believe, as a fact,
in an external world. We believe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
that there are sun and moon, stones,
sticks, and human bodies. This belief is accepted by the sceptic as
well as by the dogmatist, although the sceptic reduces it to a mere
blind custom or 'association of ideas.' Now Reid argues that the
belief, whatever its nature, is not and cannot be derived from the
sensations. We do not construct the visible and tangible world, for
example, simply out of impressions made upon the senses of sight and
touch. To prove this, he examines what are the actual data provided by
these senses, and shows, or tries to show, that we cannot from them
alone construct the world of space and geometry. Hence, if we consider
experience impartially and without preconception, we find that it
tells us something which is not given by the senses. The senses are
not the material of our perceptions, but simply give the occasions
upon which our belief is called into activity. The sensation is no
more like the reality in which we believe than the pain of a wound is
like the edge of the knife. Perception tells us directly and
immediately, without the intervention of ideas, that there is, as we
all believe, a real external world.</p>

<p>Reid was a vigorous reasoner, and credit has been given to him by some
disciples of Kant's doctrine of time and space. Schopenhauer<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> says
that Reid's 'excellent work' gives a complete 'negative proof of the
Kantian truths'; that is to say, that Reid proves satisfactorily that
we cannot construct the world out of the sense-given data alone. But,
whereas Kant regards the senses as supplying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the materials moulded by
the perceiving mind, Reid regards them as mere stimuli exciting
certain inevitable beliefs. As a result of Reid's method, then, we
have 'intuitions.' Reid's essential contention is that a fair
examination of experience will reveal certain fundamental beliefs,
which cannot be explained as mere manifestations of the sensations,
and which, by the very fact that they are inexplicable, must be
accepted as an 'inspiration.'<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Reid professes to discover these
beliefs by accurately describing facts. He finds them there as a
chemist finds an element. The 'intuition' is made by substituting for
'ideas' a mysterious and inexplicable connection between the mind and
matter.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The chasm exists still, but it is somehow bridged by a
quasi-miracle. Admitting, therefore, that Reid shows a gap to exist in
the theory, his result remains 'negative.' The philosopher will say
that it is not enough to assert a principle dogmatically without
showing its place in a reasoned system of thought. The psychologist,
on the other hand, who takes Reid's own ground, may regard the
statement only as a useful challenge to further inquiry. The analysis
hitherto given may be insufficient, but where Reid has failed, other
inquirers may be more successful. As soon, in fact, as we apply the
psychological method, and regard the 'philosophy of mind' as an
'inductive science,' it is perilous, if not absolutely inconsistent,
to discover 'intuitions' which will take us beyond experience. The
line of defence against empiricism
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
can only be provisional and
temporary. In his main results, indeed, Reid had the advantage of
being on the side of 'common sense.' Everybody was already convinced
that there were sticks and stones, and everybody is prepared to hear
that their belief is approved by philosophy. But a difficulty arises
when a similar method is applied to a doctrine sincerely disputed. To
the statement, 'this is a necessary belief,' it is a sufficient answer
to reply, 'I don't believe it,' In that case, an intuition merely
amounts to a dogmatic assumption that I am infallible, and must be
supported by showing its connection with beliefs really universal and
admittedly necessary.</p>

<p>Dugald Stewart followed Reid upon this main question, and with less
force and originality represents the same point of view. He accepts
Reid's view of the two co-ordinate departments of knowledge; the
science of which mind, and the science of which body, is the object.
Philosophy is not a 'theory of knowledge' or of the universe; but, as
it was then called, 'a philosophy of the human mind.' 'Philosophy' is
founded upon inductive psychology; and it only becomes philosophy in a
wider sense in so far as we discover that as a fact we have certain
fundamental beliefs, which are thus given by experience, though they
take us in a sense beyond experience. Jeffrey, reviewing Stewart's
life of Reid, in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> of 1804, makes a significant
inference from this. Bacon's method, he said, had succeeded in the
physical sciences, because there we could apply experiment. But
experiment is impossible in the science of mind; and therefore
philosophy will never be anything but a plaything or a useful variety
of gymnastic. Stewart replied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
at some length in his <i>Essays</i>,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
fully accepting the general conception, but arguing that the
experimental method was applicable to the science of mind. Jeffrey
observes that it was now admitted that the 'profoundest reasonings'
had brought us back to the view of the vulgar, and this, too, is
admitted by Stewart so far as the cardinal doctrine of 'the common
sense' philosophy, the theory of perception, is admitted.</p>

<p>From this, again, it follows that the 'notions we annex to the words
Matter and Mind are merely relative.'<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> We know that mind exists as
we know that matter exists; or, if anything, we know the existence of
mind more certainly because more directly. The mind is suggested by
'the subjects of our consciousness'; the body by the objects 'of our
perception.' But, on the other hand, we are totally 'ignorant of the
essence of either.'<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> We can discover the laws either of mental or
moral phenomena; but a law, as he explains, means in strictness
nothing but a 'general fact.'<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> It is idle, therefore, to explain
the nature of the union between the two unknowable substances; we can
only discover that they are united and observe the laws according to
which one set of phenomena corresponds to the other. From a
misunderstanding of this arise all the fallacies of scholastic
ontology, 'the most idle and absurd speculation that ever employed the
human faculties.'<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The destruction of that pseudo-science was the
great glory of Bacon and Locke; and Reid has now discovered the method
by which we may advance to the establishment of a truly inductive
'philosophy of mind.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
It is not surprising that Stewart approximates in various directions
to the doctrines of the empirical school. He leans towards them
whenever he does not see the results to which he is tending. Thus, for
example, he is a thoroughgoing nominalist;<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and on this point he
deserts the teaching of Reid. He defends against Reid the attack made
by Berkeley and Hume upon 'abstract ideas.' Rosmini,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> in an
elaborate criticism, complains that Stewart did not perceive the
inevitable tendency of nominalism to materialism.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Stewart, in
fact, accepts a good deal of Horne Tooke's doctrine,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> though
calling Tooke an 'ingenious grammarian, not a very profound
philosopher,' but holds, as we shall see, that the materialistic
tendency can be avoided. As becomes a nominalist, he attacks the
syllogism upon grounds more fully brought out by J. S. Mill. Upon
another essential point, he agrees with the pure empiricists. He
accepts Hume's view of causation in all questions of physical science.
In natural philosophy, he declares causation means only conjunction.
The senses can never give us the 'efficient' cause of any phenomenon.
In other words, we can never see a 'necessary connection' between any
two events. He collects passages from earlier writers to show how Hume
had been anticipated; and holds that Bacon's inadequate view of this
truth was a main defect in his theories.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Hence we have a
characteristic conclusion. He says, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
discussing the proofs of the
existence of God,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> that we have an 'irresistible conviction of the
<i>necessity</i> of a cause' for every change. Hume, however, has shown
that this can never be a logical necessity. It must then, argues
Stewart, be either a 'prejudice' or an 'intuitive judgment.' Since it
is shown by 'universal consent' not to be a prejudice, it must be an
intuitive judgment. Thus Hume's facts are accepted; but his inference
denied. The actual causal nexus is inscrutable. The conviction that
there must be a connection between events attributed by Hume to
'custom' is attributed by Stewart to intuitive belief. Stewart infers
that Hume's doctrine is really favourable to theology. It implies that
God gives us the conviction, and perhaps, as Malebranche held, that
God is 'the constantly operating efficient Cause in the material
world.'<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Stewart's successor, Thomas Brown, took up this argument
on occasion of the once famous 'Leslie controversy'; and Brown's
teaching was endorsed by James Mill and by John Stuart Mill.</p>

<p>According to J. S. Mill, James Mill and Stewart represented opposite
poles of philosophic thought. I shall have to consider this dictum
hereafter. On the points already noticed Stewart must be regarded as
an ally rather than an opponent of the Locke and Hume tradition. Like
them he appeals unhesitatingly to experience, and cannot find words
strong enough to express his contempt for 'ontological' and scholastic
methods. His 'intuitions' are so far very harmless things, which fall
in with common sense, and enable him to hold without further trouble
the beliefs which, as a matter of fact, are held by everybody. They
are an excuse for not seeking any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
ultimate explanation in reason. He
is, indeed, opposed to the school which claimed to be the legitimate
successor to Locke, but which evaded Hume's scepticism by diverging
towards materialism. The great representative of this doctrine in
England had been Hartley, and in Stewart's day Hartley's lead had been
followed by Priestley, who attacked Reid from a materialist point of
view, by Priestley's successor, Thomas Belsham, and by Erasmus Darwin.
We find Stewart, in language which reminds us of later controversy,
denouncing the 'Darwinian School'<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> for theories about instinct
incompatible with the doctrine of final causes. It might appear that a
philosopher who has re-established the objective existence of space in
opposition to Berkeley, was in danger of that materialism which had
been Berkeley's bugbear. But Stewart escapes the danger by his
assertion that our knowledge of matter is 'relative' or confined to
phenomena. Materialism is for him a variety of ontology, involving the
assumption that we know the essence of matter. To speak with Hartley
of 'vibrations,' animal spirits, and so forth, is to be led astray by
a false analogy. We can discover the laws of correspondence of mind
and body, but not the ultimate nature of either.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Thus he regards
the 'physiological metaphysics of the present day' as an 'idle waste
of labour and ingenuity on questions to which the human mind is
altogether incompetent.'<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The principles found by inductive
observation are as independent of these speculations as Newton's
theory of gravitation of an ultimate mechanical cause of gravitation.</p>

<p>Hartley's followers, however, could drop the 'vibration'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
theory; and
their doctrine then became one of 'association of ideas.' To this
famous theory, which became the sheet-anchor of the empirical school,
Stewart is not altogether opposed. We find him speaking of
'indissoluble association' in language which reminds us of the
Mills.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Hume had spoken of association as comparable to
gravitation&mdash;the sole principle by which our 'ideas' and 'impressions'
are combined into a whole; a theory, of course, corresponding to his
doctrine of 'belief' as a mere custom of associating. Stewart uses the
principle rather as Locke had done, as explaining fallacies due to
'casual associations.' It supposes, as he says, the previous existence
of certain principles, and cannot be an ultimate explanation. The only
question can be at what point we have reached an 'original principle,'
and are therefore bound to stop our analysis.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Over this question
he glides rather too lightly, as is his custom; but from his point of
view the belief, for example, in an external world, cannot be
explained by association, inasmuch as it reveals itself as an ultimate
datum.</p>

<p>In regard to the physical sciences, then, Stewart's position
approximates very closely to the purely 'empirical' view. When we come
to a different application of his principles, we find him taking a
curiously balanced position between different schools. 'Common sense'
naturally wishes to adapt itself to generally accepted beliefs; and
with so flexible a doctrine as that of 'intuitions' it is not
difficult to discover methods of proving the ordinary dogmas.
Stewart's theology is characteristic of this tendency. He describes
the so-called <i>a priori</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
proof, as formulated by Clarke. But without
denying its force, he does not like to lay stress upon it. He dreads
'ontology' too much. He therefore considers that the argument at once
most satisfactory to the philosopher and most convincing to ordinary
men is the argument from design. The belief in God is not 'intuitive,'
but follows immediately from two first principles: the principle that
whatever exists has a cause, and the principle that a 'combination of
means implies a designer.'<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The belief in a cause arises on our
perception of change as our belief in the external world arises upon
our sensations. The belief in design must be a 'first principle'
because it includes a belief in 'necessity' which cannot arise from
mere observation of 'contingent truths.'<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Hence Stewart accepts
the theory of final causes as stated by Paley. Though Paley's ethics
offended him, he has nothing but praise for the work upon <i>Natural
Theology</i>.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Thus, although 'common sense' does not enable us to
lay down the central doctrine of theology as a primary truth, it does
enable us to interpret experience in theological terms. In other
words, his theology is of the purely empirical kind, which was, as we
shall see, the general characteristic of the time.</p>

<p>In Stewart's discussion of ethical problems the same doctrine of
'final causes' assumes a special importance. Stewart, as elsewhere,
tries to hold an intermediate position; to maintain the independence
of morality without committing himself to the 'ontological' or purely
logical view; and to show that virtue conduces to happiness without
allowing that its dictates are to be deduced from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
its tendency to
produce happiness. His doctrine is to a great extent derived from the
teaching of Hutcheson and Bishop Butler. He really approximates most
closely to Hutcheson, who takes a similar view of Utilitarianism, but
he professes the warmest admiration of Butler. He explicitly accepts
Butler's doctrine of the 'supremacy of the conscience'&mdash;a doctrine
which as he says, the bishop, 'has placed in the strongest and
happiest light.'<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> He endeavours, again, to approximate to the
'intellectual school,' of which Richard Price (1723-1791) was the
chief English representative at the time. Like Kant, Price deduces the
moral law from principles of pure reason. The truth of the moral law,
'Thou shalt do to others as you wish that they should do to you,' is
as evident as the truth of the law in geometry, 'things which are
equal to the same thing are equal to each other.' Stewart so far
approves that he wishes to give to the moral law what is now called
all possible 'objectivity,' while the 'moral sense' of Hutcheson
apparently introduced a 'subjective' element. He holds, however, that
our moral perceptions 'involve a feeling of the heart,' as well as a
'judgment of the understanding,'<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and ascribes the same view to
Butler. But then, by using the word 'reason' so as to include the
whole nature of a rational being, we may ascribe to it the 'origin of
those simple ideas which are not excited in the mind by the operation
of the senses, but which arise in consequence of the operation of the
intellectual powers among the various objects.'<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Hutcheson, he
says, made his 'moral sense' unsatisfactory by taking his
illustrations from the 'secondary' instead of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
'primary
qualities,'<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and thus with the help of intuitive first principles,
Stewart succeeds in believing that it would be as hard for a man to
believe that he ought to sacrifice another man's happiness to his own
as to believe that three angles of a triangle are equal to one right
angle.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> It is true that a feeling and a judgment are both
involved; but the 'intellectual judgment' is the groundwork of the
feeling, not the feeling of the judgment.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In spite, however, of
this attempt to assimilate his principles to those of the intellectual
school, the substance of Stewart's ethics is essentially
psychological. It rests, in fact, upon his view that philosophy
depends upon inductive psychology, and, therefore, essentially upon
experience subject to the cropping up of convenient 'intuitions.'</p>

<p>This appears from the nature of his argument against the Utilitarians.
In his time, this doctrine was associated with the names of Hartley,
Tucker, Godwin, and especially Paley. He scarcely refers to
Bentham.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Paley is the recognised anvil for the opposite school.
Now he agrees, as I have said, with Paley's view of natural theology
and entirely accepts therefore the theory of 'final causes.' The same
theory becomes prominent in his ethical teaching. We may perhaps say
that Stewart's view is in substance an inverted Utilitarianism. It may
be best illustrated by an argument familiar in another application.
Paley and his opponents might agree that the various instincts of an
animal are so constituted that in point of fact they contribute to
his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
preservation and his happiness. But from one point of view this
appears to be simply to say that the conditions of existence
necessitate a certain harmony, and that the harmony is therefore to be
a consequence of his self-preservation. From the opposite point of
view, which Stewart accepts, it appears that the self-preservation is
the consequence of a pre-established harmony, which has been divinely
appointed in order that he may live. Stewart, in short, is a
'teleologist' of the Paley variety. Psychology proves the existence of
design in the moral world, as anatomy or physiology proves it in the
physical.</p>

<p>Stewart therefore fully agrees that virtue generally produces
happiness. If it be true (a doctrine, he thinks, beyond our competence
to decide) that 'the sole principle of action in the Deity' is
benevolence, it may be that he has commanded us to be virtuous because
he sees virtue to be useful. In this case utility may be the final
cause of morality; and the fact that virtue has this tendency gives
the plausibility to utilitarian systems.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> But the key to the
difficulty is the distinction between 'final' and 'efficient' causes;
for the efficient cause of morality is not the desire for happiness,
but a primitive and simple instinct, namely, the moral faculty.</p>

<p>Thus he rejects Paley's notorious doctrine that virtue differs from
prudence only in regarding the consequences in another world instead
of consequences in this.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Reward and punishment 'presuppose the
notions of right and wrong' and cannot be the source of those notions.
The favourite doctrine of association,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
by which the Utilitarians
explained unselfishness, is only admissible as accounting for
modifications, such as are due to education and example, but
'presupposes the existence of certain principles which are common to
all mankind.' The evidence of such principles is established by a long
and discursive psychological discussion. It is enough to say that he
admits two rational principles, 'self-love' and the 'moral faculty,'
the coincidence of which is learned only by experience. The moral
faculty reveals simple 'ideas' of right and wrong, which are incapable
of any further analysis. But besides these, there is a hierarchy of
other instincts or desires, which he calls 'implanted' because 'for
aught we know' they may be of 'arbitrary appointment.'<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
Resentment, for example, is an implanted instinct, of which the 'final
cause' is to defend us against 'sudden violence.'<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Stewart's
analysis is easygoing and suggests more problems than it solves. The
general position, however, is clear enough, and not, I think, without
much real force as against the Paley form of utilitarianism.</p>

<p>The acceptance of the doctrine of 'final causes' was the inevitable
course for a philosopher who wishes to retain the old creeds and yet
to appeal unequivocally to experience. It suits the amiable optimism
for which Stewart is noticeable. To prove the existence of a perfect
deity from the evidence afforded by the world, you must of course take
a favourable view of the observable order. Stewart shows the same
tendency in his Political Economy, where he is Adam Smith's disciple,
and fully shares Smith's beliefs that the harmony between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> the
interests of the individual and the interests of the society is an
evidence of design in the Creator of mankind. In this respect Stewart
differs notably from Butler, to whose reasonings he otherwise owed a
good deal. With Butler the conscience implies a dread of divine wrath
and justifies the conception of a world alienated from its maker.
Stewart's 'moral faculty' simply recognises or reveals the moral law;
but carries no suggestion of supernatural penalties. The doctrines by
which Butler attracted some readers and revolted others throw no
shadow over his writings. He is a placid enlightened professor, whose
real good feeling and frequent shrewdness should not be overlooked in
consequence of the rather desultory and often superficial mode of
reasoning. This, however, suggests a final remark upon Stewart's
position.</p>

<p>In the preface<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> to his <i>Active and Moral Powers</i> (1828) Stewart
apologises for the large space given to the treatment of Natural
Religion. The lectures, he says, which form the substance of the book,
were given at a time when 'enlightened zeal for liberty' was
associated with the 'reckless boldness of the uncompromising
freethinker.' He wished, therefore, to show that a man could be a
liberal without being an atheist. This gives the position
characteristic of Stewart and his friends. The group of eminent men
who made Edinburgh a philosophical centre was thoroughly in sympathy
with the rationalist movement of the eighteenth century. The old
dogmatic system of belief could be held very lightly even by the more
educated clergy. Hume's position is significant. He could lay down the
most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
unqualified scepticism in his writings; but he always regarded
his theories as intended for the enlightened; he had no wish to
disturb popular beliefs in theology, and was a strong Tory in
politics. His friends were quite ready to take him upon that footing.
The politeness with which 'Mr. Hume's' speculations are noticed by men
like Stewart and Reid is in characteristic contrast to the reception
generally accorded to more popular sceptics. They were intellectual
curiosities not meant for immediate application. The real opinion of
such men as Adam Smith and Stewart was probably a rather vague and
optimistic theism. In the professor's chair they could talk to lads
intended for the ministry without insulting such old Scottish
prejudice (there was a good deal of it) as survived: and could cover
rationalising opinions under language which perhaps might have a
different meaning for their hearers. The position was necessarily one
of tacit compromise. Stewart considers himself to be an inductive
philosopher appealing frankly to experience and reason; and was in
practice a man of thoroughly liberal and generous feelings. He was
heartily in favour of progress as he understood it. Only he will not
sacrifice common sense; that is to say, the beliefs which are in fact
prevalent and congenial to existing institutions. Common sense, of
course, condemns extremes: and if logic seems to be pushing a man
towards scepticism in philosophy or revolution in practice, he can
always protest by the convenient device of intuitions.</p>

<p>I have gone so far in order to illustrate the nature of the system
which the Utilitarians took to be the antithesis of their own. It may
be finally remarked that at present
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
both sides were equally ignorant
of contemporary developments of German thought. When Stewart became
aware that there was such a thing as Kant's philosophy, he tried to
read it in a Latin version. Parr, I may observe, apparently did not
know of this version, and gave up the task of reading German.
Stewart's example was not encouraging. He had abandoned the
'undertaking in despair' partly from the scholastic barbarism of the
style, partly 'my utter inability to comprehend the author's meaning.'
He recognises similarity between Kant and Reid, but thinks Reid's
simple statement of the fact that space cannot be derived from the
senses more philosophical than Kant's 'superstructure of technical
mystery.'<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>I have dwelt upon the side in which Stewart's philosophy approximates
to the empirical school, because the Utilitarians were apt to
misconceive the position. They took Stewart to be the adequate
representative of all who accepted one branch of an inevitable
dilemma. The acceptance of 'intuitions,' that is, was the only
alternative to thoroughgoing acceptance of 'experience.' They
supposed, too, that persons vaguely described as 'Kant and the
Germans' taught simply a modification of the 'intuitionist' view. I
have noticed how emphatically Stewart claimed to rely upon experience
and to base his philosophy upon inductive psychology, and was so far
admitting the first principles and the general methods of his
opponents. The Scottish philosophy, however, naturally presented
itself as an antagonistic force to the Utilitarians. The 'intuitions'
represented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the ultimate ground taken, especially in religious and
ethical questions, by men who wished to be at once liberal
philosophers and yet to avoid revolutionary extremes. 'Intuitions' had
in any case a negative value, as protests against the sufficiency of
the empirical analysis. It might be quite true, for example, that
Hume's analysis of certain primary mental phenomena&mdash;of our belief in
the external world or of the relation of cause and effect&mdash;was
radically insufficient. He had not given an adequate explanation of
the facts. The recognition of the insufficiency of his reasoning was
highly important if only as a stimulus to inquiry. It was a warning to
his and to Hartley's followers that they had not thoroughly unravelled
the perplexity but only cut the knot. But when the insufficiency of
the explanation was interpreted as a demonstration that all
explanation was impossible, and the 'intuition' an ultimate
'self-evident' truth, it became a refusal to inquire just where
inquiry was wanted; a positive command to stop analysis at an
arbitrary point; and a round assertion that the adversary could not
help believing precisely the doctrine which he altogether declined to
believe. Naturally the empiricists refused to bow to an authority
which was simply saying, 'Don't inquire further,' without any ground
for the prohibition except the '<i>ipse dixitism</i>' which declared that
inquiry must be fruitless. Stewart, in fact, really illustrated the
equivocation between the two meanings of 'common sense.' If by that
name he understood, as he professed to understand, ultimate 'laws of
thought,' his position was justifiable as soon as he could specify the
laws and prove that they were ultimate. But so far as he virtually
took for granted that the average beliefs of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
intelligent people were
such laws, and on that ground refused to examine the evidence of their
validity, he was inconsistent, and his position only invited assault.
As a fact, I believe that his 'intuitions' covered many most
disputable propositions; and that the more clearly they were stated,
the more they failed to justify his interpretations. He was not really
answering the most vital and critical questions, but implicitly
reserving them, and putting an arbitrary stop to investigations
desirable on his own principles.</p>

<p>The Scottish philosophy was, however, accepted in England, and made a
considerable impression in France, as affording a tenable barrier
against scepticism. It was, as I have said, in philosophy what
Whiggism was in politics. Like political Whiggism it included a large
element of enlightened and liberal rationalism; but like Whiggism it
covered an aversion to thoroughgoing logic. The English politician was
suspicious of abstract principles, but could cover his acceptance of
tradition and rule of thumb by general phrases about liberty and
toleration. The Whig in philosophy equally accepted the traditional
creed, sufficiently purified from cruder elements, and sheltered his
doctrine by speaking of 'intuitions and laws of thought.' In both
positions there was really, I take it, a great deal of sound practical
wisdom; but they also implied a marked reluctance to push inquiry too
far, and a tacit agreement to be content with what the Utilitarians
denounced as 'vague generalities'&mdash;phrases, that is, which might be
used either to conceal an underlying scepticism, or really to stop
short in the path which led to scepticism. In philosophy as in
politics, the Utilitarians boasted of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
being thoroughgoing Radicals,
and hated compromises which to them appeared to be simply obstructive.
I need not elaborate a point which will meet us again. If I were
writing a history of thought in general I should have to notice other
writers, though there were none of much distinction, who followed the
teaching of Stewart or of his opponents of the Hartley and Darwin
school. It would be necessary also to insist upon the growing interest
in the physical sciences, which were beginning not only to make
enormous advances, but to attract popular attention. For my purpose,
however, it is I think sufficient to mention these writers, each of
whom had a very special relation to the Utilitarians. I turn,
therefore, to Bentham.</p>

<h3>BENTHAM'S LIFE</h3>

<p class="scs">I. <a name="V_I" id="V_I"></a>EARLY LIFE</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Jeremy Bentham,<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> the patriarch of the English Utilitarians, sprang
from the class imbued most thoroughly with the typical English
prejudices. His first recorded ancestor, Brian Bentham, was a
pawnbroker, who lost money by the stop of the Exchequer in 1672, but
was neither ruined, nor, it would seem, alienated by the king's
dishonesty. He left some thousands to his son, Jeremiah, an attorney
and a strong Jacobite. A second Jeremiah, born 2nd December 1712,
carried on his father's business, and though his clients were not
numerous, increased his fortune by judicious investments in houses and
lands. Although brought up in Jacobite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
principles, he transferred his
attachment to the Hanoverian dynasty when a relation of his wife
married a valet of George <small>II.</small> The wife, Alicia Grove, was daughter of
a tradesman who had made a small competence at Andover. Jeremiah
Bentham had fallen in love with her at first sight, and wisely gave up
for her sake a match with a fortune of &pound;10,000. The couple were fondly
attached to each other and to their children. The marriage took place
towards the end of 1744, and the eldest son, Jeremy, was born in Red
Lion Street, Houndsditch, 4th February 1747-48 (o.s.) The only other
child who grew up was Samuel, afterwards Sir Samuel Bentham, born 11th
January 1757. When eighty years old, Jeremy gave anecdotes of his
infancy to his biographer, Bowring, who says that their accuracy was
confirmed by contemporary documents, and proved his memory to be as
wonderful as his precocity. Although the child was physically puny,
his intellectual development was amazing. Before he was two he burst
into tears at the sight of his mother's chagrin upon his refusal of
some offered dainty. Before he was 'breeched,' an event which happened
when he was three and a quarter, he ran home from a dull walk, ordered
a footman to bring lights and place a folio <i>Rapin</i> upon the table,
and was found plunged in historical studies when his parents returned
to the house. In his fourth year he was imbibing the Latin grammar,
and at the age of five years nine months and nineteen days, as his
father notes, he wrote a scrap of Latin, carefully pasted among the
parental memoranda. The child was not always immured in London. His
parents spent their Sundays with the grandfather Bentham at Barking,
and made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
occasional excursions to the house of Mrs. Bentham's mother
at Browning Hill, near Reading. Bentham remembered the last as a
'paradise,' and a love of flowers and gardens became one of his
permanent passions.</p>

<p>Jeremy cherished the memory of his mother's tenderness. The father,
though less sympathetic, was proud of his son's precocity, and
apparently injudicious in stimulating the unformed intellect. The boy
was almost a dwarf in size. When sixteen he grew ahead,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and was
so feeble that he could scarcely drag himself upstairs. Attempts to
teach him dancing failed from the extreme weakness of his knees.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
He showed a taste for music, and could scrape a minuet on the fiddle
at six years of age. He read all such books as came in his way. His
parents objected to light literature, and he was crammed with such
solid works as <i>Rapin</i>, Burnet's <i>Theory of the Earth</i>, and Cave's
<i>Lives of the Apostles</i>. Various accidents, however, furnished him
with better food for the imagination. He wept for hours over <i>Clarissa
Harlowe</i>, studied <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> as an authentic document, and
dipped into a variety of such books as then drifted into middle-class
libraries. A French teacher introduced him to some remarkable books.
He read <i>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i>, which deeply impressed him, and, as he thought,
implanted in his mind the seeds of later moralising. He attacked
unsuccessfully some of Voltaire's historical works, and even read
<i>Candide</i>, with what emotions we are not told. The servants meanwhile
filled his fancy with ghosts and hobgoblins. To the end of his days he
was still haunted by the imaginary horrors in the dark,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> and he
says<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> that they had been among the torments of his life. He had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
few companions of his own age, and though he was 'not unhappy' and was
never subjected to corporal punishment, he felt more awe than
affection for his father. His mother, to whom he was strongly
attached, died on 6th January 1759.</p>

<p>Bentham was thus a strangely precocious, and a morbidly sensitive
child, when it was decided in 1755 to send him to Westminster. The
headmaster, Dr. Markham, was a friend of his father's. Westminster, he
says, represented 'hell' for him when Browning Hill stood for
paradise. The instruction 'was wretched,' The fagging system was a
'horrid despotism.' The games were too much for his strength. His
industry, however, enabled him to escape the birch, no small
achievement in those days,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and he became distinguished in the
studies such as they were. He learned the catechism by heart, and was
good at Greek and Latin verses, which he manufactured for his
companions as well as himself. He had also the rarer accomplishment,
acquired from his early tutor, of writing more easily in French than
English. Some of his writings were originally composed in French. He
was, according to Bowring, elected to one of the King's scholarships
when between nine and ten, but as 'ill-usage was apprehended' the
appointment was declined.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> He was at a boarding-house, and the
life of the boys on the foundation was probably rougher. In June 1760
his father took him to Oxford, and entered him as a commoner at
Queen's College. He came into residence in the following October, when
only twelve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
years old. Oxford was not more congenial than
Westminster. He had to sign the Thirty-nine Articles in spite of
scruples suppressed by authority. The impression made upon him by this
childish compliance never left him to the end of his life.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> His
experience resembled that of Adam Smith and Gibbon. Laziness and vice
were prevalent. A gentleman commoner of Queen's was president of a
'hellfire club,' and brutal horseplay was still practised upon the
weaker lads. Bentham, still a schoolboy in age, continued his
schoolboy course. He wrote Latin verses, and one of his experiments,
an ode upon the death of George <small>II.</small>, was sent to Johnson, who called
it 'a very pretty performance for a young man.' He also had to go
through the form of disputation in the schools. Queen's College had
some reputation at this time for teaching logic.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Bentham was set
to read Watt's <i>Logic</i> (1725), Sanderson's <i>Compendium artis Logicae</i>
(1615), and Rowning's <i>Compendious System of Natural Philosophy</i>
(1735-42). Some traces of these studies remained in his mind.</p>

<p>In 1763 Bentham took his B.A. degree, and returned to his home. It is
significant that when robbed of all his money at Oxford he did not
confide in his father. He was paying by a morbid reserve for the
attempts made to force him into premature activity. He accepted the
career imposed by his father's wishes, and in November 1763 began to
eat his dinners in Lincoln's Inn. He returned, however, to Oxford in
December to hear Blackstone's lectures. These lectures were then a
novelty at an English university. The Vinerian professorship had been
founded in 1758 in consequence of the success of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
course voluntarily
given by Blackstone; and his lectures contained the substance of the
famous Commentaries, first published 1765-1769. They had a great
effect upon Bentham. He says that he 'immediately detected
Blackstone's fallacy respecting natural rights,' thought other
doctrines illogical, and was so much occupied by these reflections as
to be unable to take notes. Bentham's dissatisfaction with Blackstone
had not yet made him an opponent of the constituted order. He was
present at some of the proceedings against Wilkes, and was perfectly
bewitched by Lord Mansfield's '<i>Grim-gibber</i>,' that is, taken in by
his pompous verbiage.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>In 1765 his father married Mrs. Abbot, the mother of Charles Abbot,
afterwards Lord Colchester. Bentham's dislike of his step-mother
increased the distance between him and his father. He took his M.A.
degree in 1766 and in 1767 finally left Oxford for London to begin, as
his father fondly hoped, a flight towards the woolsack. The lad's
diffidence and extreme youth had indeed prevented him from forming the
usual connections which his father anticipated as the result of a
college life. His career as a barrister was short and grievously
disappointing to the parental hopes. His father, like the Elder
Fairford in <i>Redgauntlet</i>, had 'a cause or two at nurse' for the son.
The son's first thought was to 'put them to death,' A brief was given
to him in a suit, upon which &pound;50 depended. He advised that the suit
should be dropped and the money saved. Other experiences only
increased his repugnance to his profession.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> A singularly strong
impression had been made upon him by the <i>Memoirs</i> of Teresa
Constantia Phipps, in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
there is an account of vexatious legal
proceedings as to the heroine's marriage. He appears to have first
read this book in 1759. Then, he says, the 'Demon of Chicane appeared
to me in all his hideousness. I vowed war against him. My vow has been
accomplished!'<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Bentham thus went to the bar as a 'bear to the
stake.' He diverged in more than one direction. He studied chemistry
under Fordyce (1736-1802), and hankered after physical science. He was
long afterwards (1788) member of a club to which Sir Joseph Banks,
John Hunter, R. L. Edgeworth, and other men of scientific reputation
belonged.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> But he had drifted into a course of speculation, which,
though more germane to legal studies, was equally fatal to
professional success. The father despaired, and he was considered to
be a 'lost child.'</p>

<p class="scs">II. <a name="V_II" id="V_II"></a>FIRST WRITINGS</p>

<p>Though lost to the bar, he had really found himself. He had taken the
line prescribed by his idiosyncrasy. His father's injudicious forcing
had increased his shyness at the bar, and he was like an owl in
daylight. But no one, as we shall see, was less diffident in
speculation. Self-confidence in a philosopher is often the private
credit which he opens with his imagination to compensate for his
incapacity in the rough struggles of active life. Bentham shrank from
the world in which he was easily browbeaten to the study in which he
could reign supreme. He had not the strong passions which prompt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
commonplace ambition, and cared little for the prizes for which most
men will sacrifice their lives. Nor, on the other hand, can he be
credited with that ardent philanthropy or vehement indignation which
prompts to an internecine struggle with actual wrongdoers. He had not
the ardour which led Howard to devote a life to destroy abuses, or
that which turned Swift's blood to gall in the struggle against
triumphant corruption. He was thoroughly amiable, but of kindly rather
than energetic affections. He, therefore, desired reform, but so far
from regarding the ruling classes with rancour, took their part
against the democrats. 'I was a great reformist,' he says, 'but never
suspected that the "people in power" were against reform. I supposed
they only wanted to know what was good in order to embrace it.'<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
The most real of pleasures for him lay in speculating upon the general
principles by which the 'people in power' should be guided. To
construct a general chart for legislation, to hunt down sophistries,
to explode mere noisy rhetoric, to classify and arrange and
re-classify until his whole intellectual wealth was neatly arranged in
proper pigeon-holes, was a delight for its own sake. He wished well to
mankind; he detested abuses, but he hated neither the corrupted nor
the corruptors; and it might almost seem that he rather valued the
benevolent end, because it gave employment to his faculties, than
valued the employment because it led to the end. This is implied in
his remark made at the end of his life. He was, he said, as selfish as
a man could be; but 'somehow or other' selfishness had in him taken
the form of benevolence.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> He was at any rate in the position of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
man with the agreeable conviction that he has only to prove the wisdom
of a given course in order to secure its adoption. Like many
mechanical inventors, he took for granted that a process which was
shown to be useful would therefore be at once adopted, and failed to
anticipate the determined opposition of the great mass of 'vested
interests' already in possession.</p>

<p>At this period he made the discovery, or what he held to be the
discovery, which governed his whole future career. He laid down the
principle which was to give the clue to all his investigations; and,
as he thought, required only to be announced to secure universal
acceptance. When Bentham revolted against the intellectual food
provided at school and college, he naturally took up the philosophy
which at that period represented the really living stream of thought.
To be a man of enlightenment in those days was to belong to the school
of Locke. Locke represented reason, free thought, and the abandonment
of prejudice. Besides Locke, he mentions Hume, Montesquieu, Helv&eacute;tius,
Beccaria, and Barrington. Helv&eacute;tius especially did much to suggest to
him his leading principle, and upon country trips which he took with
his father and step-mother, he used to lag behind studying Helv&eacute;tius'
<i>De l'Esprit</i>.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Locke, he says in an early note (1773-1774),
should give the principles, Helv&eacute;tius the matter, of a complete digest
of the law. He mentions with especial interest the third volume of
Hume's <i>Treatise on Human Nature</i> for its ethical views: 'he felt as
if scales fell from his eyes' when he read it.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Daines
Barrington's <i>Observations on the Statutes</i> (1766) interested him by
miscellaneous suggestions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
The book, he says,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> was a 'great
treasure.' 'It is everything, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of everything; I wrote
volumes upon this volume.' Beccaria's treatise upon crimes and
punishments had appeared in 1764, and had excited the applause of
Europe. The world was clearly ready for a fundamental reconstruction
of legislative theories. Under the influence of such studies Bentham
formulated his famous principle&mdash;a principle which to some seemed a
barren truism, to others a mere epigram, and to some a dangerous
falsehood. Bentham accepted it not only as true, but as expressing a
truth of extraordinary fecundity, capable of guiding him through the
whole labyrinth of political and legislative speculation. His
'fundamental axiom' is that 'the greatest happiness of the greatest
number is the measure of right and wrong.'<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Bentham himself<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
attributes the authorship of the phrase to Beccaria or Priestley. The
general order of thought to which this theory belongs was of course
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
not the property of any special writer or any particular period. Here
I need only observe that this embodiment of the general doctrine of
utility or morality had been struck out by Hutcheson in the attempt
(as his title says) 'to introduce a mathematical calculation on
subjects of morality.' This defines the exact reason which made it
acceptable to Bentham. For the vague reference to utility which
appears in Hume and other writers of his school, he substituted a
formula, the terms of which suggest the possibility of an accurate
quantitative comparison of different sums of happiness. In Bentham's
mind the difference between this and the more general formula was like
the difference between the statement that the planets gravitate
towards the sun, and the more precise statement that the law of
gravitation varies inversely as the square of the distance. Bentham
hoped for no less an achievement than to become the Newton of the
moral world.</p>

<p>Bentham, after leaving Oxford, took chambers in Lincoln's Inn. His
father on his second marriage had settled some property upon him,
which brought in some &pound;90 a year. He had to live like a gentleman upon
this, and to give four guineas a year to the laundress, four to his
barber, and two to his shoeblack. In spite of Jeremy's deviation from
the path of preferment, the two were on friendly terms, and when the
hopes of the son's professional success grew faint, the father showed
sympathy with his literary undertakings. Jeremy visited Paris in 1770,
but made few acquaintances, though he was already regarded as a
'philosopher.' In 1778 he was in correspondence with d'Alembert, the
abb&eacute; Morellet, and other philanthropic philosophers, but it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
does not
appear at what time this connection began.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> He translated
Voltaire's <i>Taureau Blanc</i><a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>&mdash;a story which used to 'convulse him
with laughter.' A reference to it will show that Bentham by this time
took the Voltairean view of the Old Testament. Bentham, however, was
still on the side of the Tories. His first publication was a defence
of Lord Mansfield in 1770 against attacks arising out of the
prosecution of Woodfall for publishing Junius's letter to the king.
This defence, contained in two letters, signed Iren&aelig;us, was published
in the <i>Gazetteer</i>. Bentham's next performance was remarkable in the
same sense. Among the few friends who drifted to his chambers was John
Lind (1737-1781), who had been a clergyman, and after acting as tutor
to a prince in Poland, had returned to London and become a writer for
the press. He had business relations with the elder Bentham, and the
younger Bentham was to some extent his collaborator in a pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
which defended the conduct of ministers to the American colonies.
Bentham observes that he was prejudiced against the Americans by the
badness of their arguments, and thought from the first, as he
continued to think, that the Declaration of Independence was a
hodge-podge of confusion and absurdity, in which the thing to be
proved is all along taken for granted.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Two other friendships were
formed by Bentham about this time: one with James Trail, an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
unsuccessful barrister, who owed a seat in Parliament and some minor
offices to Lord Hertford, and is said by Romilly to have been a man of
great talent; and one with George Wilson, afterwards a leader of the
Norfolk circuit, who had become known to him through a common interest
in Dr. Fordyce's lectures upon chemistry. Wilson became a bosom
friend, and was one of Bentham's first disciples, though they were
ultimately alienated.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>At this time, Bentham says, that his was 'truly a miserable
life.'<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Yet he was getting to work upon his grand project. He
tells his father on 1st October 1776 that he is writing his <i>Critical
Elements of Jurisprudence</i>, the book of which a part was afterwards
published as the <i>Introduction to the Principles of Morals and
Legislation</i>.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> In the same year he published his first important
work, the <i>Fragment on Government</i>. The year was in many ways
memorable. The Declaration of Independence marked the opening of a new
political era. Adam Smith's <i>Wealth of Nations</i> and Gibbon's <i>Decline
and Fall</i> formed landmarks in speculation and in history; and
Bentham's volume, though it made no such impression, announced a
serious attempt to apply scientific methods to problems of
legislation. The preface contained the first declaration of his famous
formula which was applied to the confutation of Blackstone. Bentham
was apparently roused to this effort by recollections of the Oxford
lectures. The <i>Commentaries</i> contained a certain quantity of
philosophical rhetoric; and as Blackstone was much greater in a
literary than in a philosophical sense, the result was naturally
unsatisfactory from a scientific point
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of view. He had vaguely
appealed to the sound Whig doctrine of social compact, and while
disavowing any strict historical basis had not inquired too curiously
what was left of his supposed foundation. Bentham pounced upon the
unfortunate bit of verbiage; insisted upon asking for a meaning when
there was nothing but a rhetorical flourish, and tore the whole flimsy
fabric to rags and tatters. A more bitter attack upon Blackstone,
chiefly, as Bowring says, upon his defence of the Jewish law, was
suppressed for fear of the law of libel.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The <i>Fragment</i> was
published anonymously, but Bentham had confided the secret to his
father by way of suggesting some slight set-off against his apparent
unwillingness to emerge from obscurity. The book was at first
attributed to Lord Mansfield, Lord Camden, and to Dunning. It was
pirated in Dublin; and most of the five hundred copies printed appear
to have been sold, though without profit to the author. The father's
indiscretion let out the secret; and the sale, when the book was known
to be written by a nobody, fell off at once, or so Bentham believed.
The anonymous writer, however, was denounced and accused of being the
author of much ribaldry, and among other accusations was said to be
not only the translator but the writer of the <i>White Bull</i>.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Bentham had fancied that all manner of 'torches from the highest
regions' would come to light themselves at his 'farthing candle.' None
of them came, and he was left for some years in obscurity, though
still labouring at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the great work which was one day to enlighten the
world. At last, however, partial recognition came to him in a shape
which greatly influenced his career. Lord Shelburne, afterwards
marquis of Lansdowne, had been impressed by the <i>Fragment</i>, and in
1781 sought out Bentham at his chambers. Shelburne's career was to
culminate in the following year with his brief tenure of the
premiership (3rd July 1782 to 24th February 1783). Rightly or wrongly
his contemporaries felt the distrust indicated by his nickname
'Malagrida,' which appears to have been partly suggested by a habit of
overstrained compliment. He incurred the dislike not unfrequently
excited by men who claim superiority of intellect without possessing
the force of character which gives a corresponding weight in political
affairs. Although his education had been bad, he had something of that
cosmopolitan training which enabled many members of the aristocracy to
look beyond the narrow middle-class prejudices and share in some
degree the wider philosophical movements of the day. He had enjoyed
the friendship of Franklin, and had been the patron of Priestley, who
made some of his chemical discoveries at Bowood, and to whom he
allowed an annuity. He belonged to that section of the Whigs which had
most sympathy with the revolutionary movement. His chief political
lieutenants were Dunning and Barr&eacute;, who at the time sat for his
borough Calne. He now rapidly formed an intimacy with Bentham, who
went to stay at Bowood in the autumn of 1781. Bentham now and then in
later years made some rather disparaging remarks upon Shelburne, whom
he apparently considered to be rather an amateur than a serious
philosopher, and who in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
House of Lords talked 'vague
generalities'&mdash;the sacred phrase by which the Utilitarians denounced
all preaching but their own&mdash;in a way to impose upon the thoughtless.
He respected Shelburne, however, as one who trusted the people, and
was distrusted by the Whig aristocracy. He felt, too, a real affection
and gratitude for the patron to whom he owed so much. Shelburne had
done him a great service.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> 'He raised me from the bottomless pit
of humiliation. He made me feel I was something.' The elder Bentham
was impressed by his son's acquaintance with a man in so eminent a
position, and hoped that it might lead by a different path to the
success which had been missed at the bar. At Bowood Bentham stayed
over a month upon his first visit, and was treated in the manner
appropriate to a philosopher. The men showed him friendliness, dashed
with occasional contempt, and the ladies petted him. He met Lord
Camden and Dunning and young William Pitt, and some minor adherents of
the great man. Pitt was 'very good-natured and a little raw.' I was
monstrously 'frightened at him,' but, when I came to talk with him, he
seemed 'frightened at me.'<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Bentham, however, did not see what
ideas they were likely to have in common. In fact there was the usual
gulf between the speculative thinker and the practical man. 'All the
statesmen,' so thought the philosopher, 'were wanting in the great
elements of statesmanship': they were always talking about 'what was'
and seldom or never about 'what ought to be.'<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Occasionally, it
would seem, they descended lower, and made a little fun of the shy and
over-sensitive intruder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> The ladies, however, made it up to him.
Shelburne made him read his 'dry metaphysics' to them,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and they
received it with feminine docility. Lord Shelburne had lately (1779)
married his second wife, Louisa, daughter of the first earl of Upper
Ossory. Her sister, Lady Mary Fitz-Patrick, married in 1766 to Stephen
Fox, afterwards Lord Holland, was the mother of the Lord Holland of
later days and of Miss Caroline Fox, who survived till 1845, and was
at this time a pleasant girl of thirteen or fourteen. Lady Shelburne
had also two half-sisters, daughters of her mother's second marriage
to Richard Vernon. Lady Shelburne took a fancy to Bentham, and gave
him the 'prodigious privilege' of admission to her dressing-room.
Though haughty in manner, she was mild in reality, and after a time
she and her sister indulged in 'innocent gambols.' In her last
illness, Bentham was one of the only two men whom she would see, and
upon her death in 1789, he was the only male friend to whom her
husband turned for consolation. Miss Fox seems to have been the only
woman who inspired Bentham with a sentiment approaching to passion. He
wrote occasional letters to the ladies in the tone of elephantine
pleasantry natural to one who was all his life both a philosopher and
a child.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> He made an offer of marriage to Miss Fox in 1805, when
he was nearer sixty than fifty, and when they had not met for sixteen
years. The immediate occasion was presumably the death of Lord
Lansdowne. She replied in a friendly letter, regretting the pain which
her refusal would inflict. In 1827 Bentham, then in his eightieth
year, wrote once more, speaking of the flower she had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
given him 'in
the green lane,' and asking for a kind answer. He was 'indescribably
hurt and disappointed' by a cold and distant reply. The tears would
come into the old man's eyes as he dealt upon the cherished memories
of Bowood.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> It is pleasant to know that Bentham was once in love;
though his love seems to have been chiefly for a memory associated
with what he called the happiest time of his life.</p>

<p>Shelburne had a project for a marriage between Bentham and the widow
of Lord Ashburton (Dunning), who died in 1783.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> He also made some
overtures of patronage. 'He asked me,' says Bentham,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> 'what he
could do for me? I told him, nothing,' and this conduct&mdash;so different
from that of others, 'endeared me to him.' Bentham declined one offer
in 1788; but in 1790 he suddenly took it into his head that Lansdowne
had promised him a seat in parliament; and immediately set forth his
claims in a vast argumentative letter of sixty-one pages.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
Lansdowne replied conclusively that he had not made the supposed
promise, and had had every reason to suppose that Bentham preferred
retirement to politics. Bentham accepted the statement frankly, though
a short coolness apparently followed. The claim, in fact, only
represented one of those passing moods to which Bentham was always
giving way at odd moments.</p>

<p>Bentham's intimacy at Bowood led to more important results. In 1788 he
met Romilly and Dumont at Lord Lansdowne's table.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> He had already
met Romilly in 1784 through Wilson, but after this the intimacy became
close. Romilly had fallen in love with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
<i>Fragment</i>, and in later
life he became Bentham's adviser in practical matters, and the chief
if not the sole expounder of Bentham's theories in parliament.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
The alliance with Dumont was of even greater importance. Dumont, born
at Geneva in 1759, had become a Protestant minister; he was afterwards
tutor to Shelburne's son, and in 1788 visited Paris with Romilly and
made acquaintance with Mirabeau. Romilly showed Dumont some of
Bentham's papers written in French. Dumont offered to rewrite and to
superintend their publication. He afterwards received other papers
from Bentham himself, with whom he became personally acquainted after
his return from Paris.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Dumont became Bentham's most devoted
disciple, and laboured unweariedly upon the translation and
condensation of his master's treatise. One result is odd enough.
Dumont, it is said, provided materials for some of Mirabeau's 'most
splendid' speeches; and some of these materials came from
Bentham.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> One would like to see how Bentham's prose was transmuted
into an oratory by Mirabeau. In any case, Dumont's services to Bentham
were invaluable. It is painful to add that according to Bowring the
two became so much alienated in the end, that in 1827 Bentham refused
to see Dumont, and declared that his chief interpreter did 'not
understand a word of his meaning.' Bowring attributes this separation
to a remark made by Dumont about the shabbiness of Bentham's dinners
as compared with those at Lansdowne House&mdash;a comparison which he calls
'offensive, uncalled-for, and groundless.'<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Bentham apparently
argued that a man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
who did not like his dinners could not appreciate
his theories: a fallacy excusable only by the pettishness of old age.
Bowring, however, had a natural dulness which distorted many anecdotes
transmitted through him; and we may hope that in this case there was
some exaggeration.</p>

<p>Bentham's emergence was, meanwhile, very slow. The great men whom he
met at Lord Lansdowne's were not specially impressed by the shy
philosopher. Wedderburn, so he heard, pronounced the fatal word
'dangerous' in regard to the <i>Fragment</i>.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> How, thought Bentham,
can utility be dangerous? Is this not self-contradictory? Later
reflection explained the puzzle. What is useful to the governed need
not be therefore useful to the governors. Mansfield, who was known to
Lind, said that in some parts the author of the <i>Fragment</i> was awake
and in others was asleep. In what parts? Bentham wondered. Awake, he
afterwards considered, in the parts where Blackstone, the object of
Mansfield's personal 'heart-burning,' was attacked; asleep where
Mansfield's own despotism was threatened. Camden was contemptuous;
Dunning only 'scowled' at him; and Barr&eacute;, after taking in his book,
gave it back with the mysterious information that he had 'got into a
scrape.'<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> The great book, therefore, though printed in 1781,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
'stuck for eight years,'<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and the writer continued his obscure
existence in Lincoln's Inn.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> An opinion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
which he gave in some
question as to the evidence in Warren Hastings's trial made, he says,
an impression in his favour. Before publication was achieved, however,
a curious episode altered Bentham's whole outlook. His brother Samuel
(1757-1831), whose education he had partly superintended,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> had
been apprenticed to a shipwright at Woolwich, and in 1780 had gone to
Russia in search of employment. Three years later he was sent by
Prince Potemkin to superintend a great industrial establishment at
Kritchev on a tributary of the Dnieper. There he was to be
'Jack-of-all-trades&mdash;building ships, like Harlequin, of odds and
ends&mdash;a rope-maker, a sail-maker, a distiller, brewer, malster,
tanner, glass-man, glass-grinder, potter, hemp-spinner, smith, and
coppersmith.'<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> He was, that is, to transplant a fragment of
ready-made Western civilisation into Russia. Bentham resolved to pay a
visit to his brother, to whom he was strongly attached. He left
England in August 1785, and stayed some time at Constantinople, where
he met Maria James (1770-1836), the wife successively of W. Reveley
and of John Gisborne, and the friend of Shelley. Thence he travelled
by land to Kritchev, and settled with his brother at the neighbouring
estate of Zadobras. Bentham here passed a secluded life, interested in
his brother's occupations and mechanical inventions, and at the same
time keeping up his own intellectual labours. The most remarkable
result was the <i>Defence of Usury</i>, written in the beginning of 1787.
Bentham appends to it a respectful letter to Adam Smith, who had
supported the laws against usury inconsistently with his own general
principles. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
disciple was simply carrying out those principles to
the logical application from which the master had shrunk. The
manuscript was sent to Wilson, who wished to suppress it.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The
elder Bentham obtained it, and sent it to the press. The book met
Bentham as he was returning. It was highly praised by Thomas
Reid,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and by the <i>Monthly Review</i>; it was translated into various
languages, and became one of the sacred books of the Economists.
Wilson is described as 'cold and cautious,' and he suppressed another
pamphlet upon prison discipline.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> In a letter to Bentham, dated
26th February 1787, however, Wilson disavows any responsibility for
the delay in the publication of the great book. 'The cause,' he says,
'lies in your constitution. With one-tenth part of your genius, and a
common degree of steadiness, both Sam and you would long since have
risen to great eminence. But your history, since I have known you, has
been to be always running from a good scheme to a better. In the
meantime life passes away and nothing is completed.' He entreated
Bentham to return, and his entreaties were seconded by Trail, who
pointed out various schemes of reform, especially of the poor-laws, in
which Bentham might be useful. Wilson had mentioned already another
inducement to publication. 'There is,' he says, on 24th September
1786, 'a Mr. Paley, a parson and archdeacon of Carlisle, who has
written a book called <i>Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy</i>,
in quarto, and it has gone through two editions with prodigious
applause.' He fears that Bentham will be charged with stealing from
Paley, and exhorts him to come home and 'establish a great literary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
reputation in your own language, and in this country which you
despise.'<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Bentham at last started homewards. He travelled through
Poland, Germany, and Holland, and reached London at the beginning of
February 1788. He settled at a little farmhouse at Hendon, bought a
'superb harpsichord,' resumed his occupations, and saw a small circle
of friends. Wilson urged him to publish his <i>Introduction</i> without
waiting to complete the vast scheme to which it was to be a prologue.
Copies of the printed book were already abroad, and there was a danger
of plagiarism. Thus urged, Bentham at last yielded, and the
<i>Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation</i> appeared in
1789. The preface apologised for imperfections due to the plan of his
work. The book, he explained, laid down the principles of all his
future labours, and was to stand to him in the relation of a treatise
upon pure mathematics to a treatise upon the applied sciences. He
indicated ten separate departments of legislation, each of which would
require a treatise in order to the complete execution of his scheme.</p>

<p>The book gives the essence of Bentham's theories, and is the one large
treatise published by himself. The other works were only brought to
birth by the help of disciples. Dumont, in the discourse prefixed to
the <i>Trait&eacute;s</i>, explains the reason. Bentham, he says, would suspend a
whole work and begin a new one because a single proposition struck him
as doubtful. A problem of finance would send him to a study of
Political Economy in general. A question of procedure would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
make him
pause until he had investigated the whole subject of judicial
organisation. While at work, he felt only the pleasure of composition.
When his materials required form and finish, he felt only the fatigue.
Disgust succeeded to charm; and he could scarcely be induced to
interrupt his labours upon fresh matter in order to give to his
interpreter the explanations necessary for the elucidation of his
previous writings. He was without the literary vanity or the desire
for completion which may prompt to premature publication, but may at
least prevent the absolute waste of what has been already achieved.
His method of writing was characteristic. He began by forming a
complete logical scheme for the treatment of any subject, dividing and
subdividing so as to secure an exhaustive classification of the whole
matter of discussion. Then taking up any subdivision, he wrote his
remarks upon sheets, which were put aside after being marked with
references indicating their place in the final treatise. He never
turned to these again. In time he would exhaust the whole subject, and
it would then be the duty of his disciples simply to put together the
bricks according to the indications placed upon each in order to
construct the whole edifice.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> As, however, the plan would
frequently undergo a change, and as each fragment had been written
without reference to the others, the task of ultimate combination and
adaptation of the ultimate atoms was often very perplexing. Bentham,
as we shall see, formed disciples ardent enough to put together these
scattered documents as the disciples of Mahomet put together the
Koran. Bentham's revelation was possibly less influential than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Mahomet's; but the logical framework was far more coherent.</p>

<p>Bentham's mind was for the present distracted. He had naturally
returned full of information about Russia. The English ministry were
involved in various negotiations with Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, the
purpose of which was to thwart the designs of Russia in the East.
Bentham wrote three letters to the <i>Public Advertiser</i>, signed
Anti-Machiavel,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> protesting against the warlike policy. Bentham
himself believed that the effect was decisive, and that the 'war was
given up' in consequence of his arguments. Historians<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> scarcely
sanction this belief, which is only worth notice because it led to
another belief, oddly characteristic of Bentham. A letter signed
'Partizan' in the <i>Public Advertiser</i> replied to his first two
letters. Who was 'Partizan'? Lord Lansdowne amused himself by
informing Bentham that he was no less a personage than George <small>III.</small>
Bentham, with even more than his usual simplicity, accepted this hoax
as a serious statement. He derived no little comfort from the thought;
for to the antipathy thus engendered in the 'best of kings' he
attributed the subsequent failure of his Panopticon scheme.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

where Bentham speaks of discovering the phrase in Priestley's <i>Essay
on Government</i> in 1768. Priestley says (p. 17) that 'the good and
happiness of the members, that is of the majority of the members, of
any state is the great standard by which everything relating to that
state must be finally determined.' So Le Mercier de la Rivi&egrave;re says,
in 1767, that the ultimate end of society is <i>assurer le plus grand
bonheur possible &agrave; la plus grande population possible</i> (Daire's
<i>&Eacute;conomistes</i>, p. 470). Hutcheson's <i>Enquiry concerning Moral Good and
Evil</i>, 1725, see iii. &sect; 8, says 'that action is best which secures the
greatest happiness of the greatest number.' Beccaria, in the preface
to his essay, speaks of <i>la massima felicit&agrave; divisa nel maggior

Galt's <i>Annals of the Parish</i>, and gave the name to the society
founded by him in 1822-1823 (<i>Autobiography</i>, p. 79). The word had
been used by Bentham himself in 1781, and he suggested it to Dumont in
1802 as the proper name of the party, instead of 'Benthamite'
(<i>Works</i>, x. 92, 390). He afterwards thought it a bad name, because it
gave a 'vague idea' (<i>Works</i>, x. 582), and substituted 'greatest
happiness principle' for 'principle of utility' (<i>Works</i>, i. 'Morals
and Legislation').</p></div>

<p class="scs">III. <a name="V_III" id="V_III"></a>THE PANOPTICON</p>

<p>The crash of the French revolution was now to change the whole course
of European politics, and to bring philosophical jurists face to face
with a long series of profoundly important problems. Bentham's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
attitude during the early stages of the revolution and the first war
period is significant, and may help to elucidate some characteristics
of the Utilitarian movement. Revolutions are the work of passion: the
product of a social and political condition in which the masses are
permeated with discontent, because the social organs have ceased to
discharge their functions. They are not ascribable to the purely
intellectual movement alone, though it is no doubt an essential
factor. The revolution came in any case because the social order was
out of joint, not simply because Voltaire or Rousseau or Diderot had
preached destructive doctrines. The doctrines of the 'rights of man'
are obvious enough to have presented themselves to many minds at many
periods. The doctrines became destructive because the old traditions
were shaken, and the traditions were shaken because the state of
things to which they corresponded had become intolerable. The French
revolution meant (among other things) that in the mind of the French
peasant there had accumulated a vast deposit of bitter enmity against
the noble who had become a mere parasite upon the labouring
population, retaining, as Arthur Young said, privileges for himself,
and leaving poverty to the lower classes. The peasant had not read
Rousseau; he had read nothing. But when his discontent began to affect
the educated classes, men who had read Rousseau found in his works the
dialect most fitted to express the growing indignation. Rousseau's
genius had devised the appropriate formula; for Rousseau's sensibility
had made him prescient of the rising storm.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
What might be a mere
commonplace for speculative students suddenly became the warcry in a
social upheaval. In England, as I have tried to show, there was no
such popular sentiment behind the political theories: and reformers
were content with measures which required no appeal to absolute rights
and general principles. Bentham was no Rousseau; and the last of men
to raise a warcry. Passion and sentimentalism were to him a nuisance.
His theories were neither suggested nor modified by the revolution. He
looked on with curious calmness, as though the revolutionary
disturbances were rather a transitory interruption to the progress of
reform than indicative of a general convulsion. His own position was
isolated. He had no strong reforming party behind him. The Whigs, his
main friends, were powerless, discredited, and themselves really
afraid to support any vigorous policy. They had in the main to content
themselves with criticising the warlike policy which, for the time,
represented the main current of national sentiment. Bentham shared
many of their sympathies. He hated the abstract 'rights of man' theory
as heartily as Burke. It was to him a 'hodge-podge' of fallacies. On
the other hand, he was absolutely indifferent to the apotheosis of the
British Constitution constructed by Burke's imagination. He cared
nothing for history in general, or regarded it, from a Voltairean
point of view, as a record of the follies and crimes of mankind. He
wished to deal with political, and especially with legal, questions in
a scientific spirit&mdash;but 'scientific' would mean not pure mathematics
but pure empiricism. He was quite as far from Paine's abstract methods
as from Burke's romantic methods.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Both of them, according to him,
were sophists: though one might prefer logical and the other
sentimental sophistries. Dumont, when he published (1802) his versions
of Bentham, insisted upon this point. Nothing, he says, was more
opposed to the trenchant dogmatism of the abstract theorists about
'rights of man' and 'equality' than Bentham's thoroughly scientific
procedure (<i>Discours Pr&eacute;liminaire</i>). Bentham's intellectual position
in this respect will require further consideration hereafter. All his
prejudices and sympathies were those of the middle class from which he
sprang. He was no democrat: he had no particular objection to the
nobility, though he preferred Shelburne to the king's friends or to
the Whig aristocracy. The reforms which he advocated were such as
might be adopted by any enlightened legislator, not only by Shelburne
but even by Blackstone. He had only, he thought, to convert a few
members of parliament to gain the acceptance for a rational criminal
code. It had hardly even occurred to him that there was anything wrong
in the general political order, though he was beginning to find out
that it was not so modifiable as he could have wished by the new ideas
which he propounded.</p>

<p>Bentham's activity during the first revolutionary war corresponded to
this position. The revolution, whatever else it might do, obviously
gave a chance to amateur legislators. There was any amount of work to
be done in the way of codifying and reforming legislative systems. The
deviser of Utopias had such an opening as had never occurred in the
world's history. Lord Lansdowne, on the 3rd January 1789, expresses
his pleasure at hearing that Bentham intends to 'take up the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
cause of
the people in France.'<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Bentham, as we have seen, was already
known to some of the French leaders, and he was now taking time by the
forelock. He sent to the abb&eacute; Morellet a part of his treatise on
Political Tactics, hoping to have it finished by the time of the
meeting of the States General.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> This treatise, civilly accepted by
Morellet, and approved with some qualifications by Bentham's
counsellors, Romilly, Wilson, and Trail, was an elaborate account of
the organisation and procedure of a legislative assembly, founded
chiefly on the practice of the House of Commons. It was published in
1816 by Dumont in company with <i>Anarchic Fallacies</i>, a vigorous
exposure of the <i>Declaration of Rights</i>, which Bentham had judiciously
kept on his shelf. Had the French known of it, he remarks afterwards,
they would have been little disposed to welcome him.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> An elaborate
scheme for the organisation of the French judiciary was suggested by a
report to the National Assembly, and published in March 1790. In 1791,
Bentham offered to go to France himself in order to establish a prison
on his new scheme (to be mentioned directly), and become 'gratuitously
the gaoler thereof.'<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> The Assembly acknowledged his 'ardent love
of humanity,' and ordered an extract from his scheme to be printed for
their instruction. The tactics actually adopted by the French
revolutionists for managing assemblies and their methods of executing
justice form a queer commentary on the philosopher who, like
Voltaire's Mamres in the <i>White Bull</i>, continued to 'meditate
profoundly' in placid disregard of facts. He was in fact proposing
that the lava boiling up in a volcanic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
eruption should arrange itself
entirely according to his architectural designs. But his proposal to
become a gaoler during the revolution reaches the pathetic by its
amiable innocence. On 26th August 1792, Bentham was one of the men
upon whom the expiring Assembly, anxious to show its desire of
universal fraternity, conferred the title of citizen. With Bentham
were joined Priestley, Paine, Wilberforce, Clarkson, Washington, and
others. The September massacres followed. On 18th October the honour
was communicated to Bentham. He replied in a polite letter, pointing
out that he was a royalist in London for the same reason which would
make him a republican in France. He ended by a calm argument against
the proscription of refugees.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> The Convention, if it read the
letter, and had any sense of humour, must have been amused. The war
and the Reign of Terror followed. Bentham turned the occasion to
account by writing a pamphlet (not then published) exhorting the
French to 'emancipate their colonies.' Colonies were an aimless
burthen, and to get rid of them would do more than conquest to relieve
their finances. British fleets and the insurrection of St. Domingo
were emancipating by very different methods.</p>

<p>Bentham was, of course, disgusted by the divergence of his clients
from the lines chalked out by proper respect for law and order. On
31st October 1793 he writes to a friend, expressing his wish that
Jacobinism could be extirpated; no price could be too heavy to pay for
such a result: but he doubts whether war or peace would be the best
means to the end, and protests against the policy of appropriating
useless and expensive colonies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
instead of 'driving at the heart of
the monster.'<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Never was an adviser more at cross-purposes with
the advised. It would be impossible to draw a more striking portrait
of the abstract reasoner, whose calculations as to human motives omit
all reference to passion, and who fancied that all prejudice can be
dispelled by a few bits of logic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a variety of suggestions more or less important and
connected with passing events were seething in his fertile brain. He
wrote one of his most stinging pamphlets, '<i>Truth versus Ashhurst</i>' in
December 1792, directed against a judge who, in the panic suggested by
the September massacres, had eulogised the English laws. Bentham's
aversion to Jacobin measures by no means softened his antipathy to
English superstitions; and his attack was so sharp that Romilly
advised and obtained its suppression for the time. Projects as to
war-taxes suggested a couple of interesting pamphlets written in 1793,
and published in 1795. In connection with this, schemes suggested
themselves to him for improved systems of patents, for limited
liability companies and other plans.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> His great work still
occupied him at intervals. In 1793 he offers to Dundas to employ
himself in drafting Statutes, and remarks incidentally that he could
legislate for Hindostan, should legislation be wanted there, as easily
as for his own parish.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> In 1794, Dumont is begging him to 'conquer
his repugnance' to bestowing a few hints upon his interpreter.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> In
1796, Bentham writes long letters suggesting that he should be sent to
France with Wilberforce, in order to re-establish friendly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
relations.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> In 1798 he is corresponding at great length with
Patrick Colquhoun upon plans for improving the Metropolitan
police.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> In 1801 he says<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> that for two years and a half 'he
has thought of scarce anything else' than a plan for interest-bearing
notes, which he carefully elaborated and discussed with Nicholas
Vansittart and Dr. Beeke. In September 1800, however, he had found
time to occupy himself with a proposed <i>frigidarium</i> or ice-house for
the preservation of fish, fruits, and vegetables; and invited Dr.
Roget, a nephew of Romilly, to come to his house and carry out the
necessary experiments.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> In January 1802 he writes to Dumont<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
proposing to send him a trifling specimen of the Panopticon, a set of
hollow fire-irons invented by his brother, which may attract the
attention of Buonaparte and Talleyrand. He proceeds to expound the
merits of Samuel's invention for making wheels by machinery. Dumont
replies, that fire-irons are 'superfluities'&mdash;(fire-arms might have
been more to Buonaparte's taste)&mdash;and that the Panopticon itself was
coldly received.</p>

<p>This Panopticon was to be Bentham's masterpiece. It occupied his chief
attention from his return to England until the peace of Amiens. His
brother had returned from Russia in 1791. Their father died 28th March
1792, dividing his property equally between his sons. Jeremy's share
consisted of the estate at Queen's Square Place, Westminster, and of
landed property producing &pound;500 or &pound;600 a year. The father, spite of
the distance between them, had treated his son with substantial
kindness, and had learned to take a pride in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
achievements very unlike
those which he had at first desired.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Bentham's position, however,
was improved by the father's death. The Westminster estate included
the house in which he lived for the rest of his life. There was a
garden in which he took great delight, though London smoke gradually
destroyed the plants: and in the garden was the small house where
Milton had once lived.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Here, with the co-operation of his brother
and his increased income, he had all the means necessary for launching
his grand scheme.</p>

<p>The Panopticon, as defined by its inventor to Brissot, was a 'mill for
grinding rogues honest, and idle men industrious.'<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> It was
suggested by a plan designed by his brother in Russia for a large
house to be occupied by workmen, and to be so arranged that they could
be under constant inspection. Bentham was working on the old lines of
philanthropic reform. He had long been interested in the schemes of
prison reform, to which Howard's labours had given the impetus.
Blackstone, with the help of William Eden, afterwards Lord Auckland,
had prepared the 'Hard Labour Bill,' which Bentham had carefully
criticised in 1778. The measure was passed in 1779, and provided for
the management of convicts, who were becoming troublesome, as
transportation to America had ceased to be possible. Howard, whose
relation to Bentham I have already noticed, was appointed as one of
the commissioners to carry out the provisions of the Act. The
commissioners disagreed; Howard resigned; and though at last an
architect (William Blackburn) was appointed who possessed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> Howard's
confidence, and who constructed various prisons in the country, the
scheme was allowed to drop. Bentham now hoped to solve the problem
with his Panopticon. He printed an account of it in 1791. He wrote to
his old antagonist, George <small>III.</small>, describing it, together with another
invention of Samuel's for enabling armies to cross rivers, which might
be more to his Majesty's taste.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> In March 1792 he made a proposal
to the government offering to undertake the charge of a thousand
convicts upon the Panopticon system.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> After delays suspicious in
the eyes of Bentham, but hardly surprising at such a period, an act of
parliament was obtained in 1794 to adopt his schemes. Bentham had
already been making preparations. He says<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> (14th September 1794)
that he has already spent &pound;6000, and is spending at the rate of &pound;2000
a year, while his income was under &pound;600 a year. He obtained, however,
&pound;2000 from the government. He had made models and architectural plans,
in which he was helped by Reveley, already known to him at
Constantinople. This sum, it appears, was required in order to keep
together the men whom he employed. The nature of their employment is
remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Samuel, a man of singular mechanical skill, which was
of great use to the navy during the war, had devised machinery for
work in wood and metal. Bentham had joined his brother, and they were
looking out for a steam-engine. It had now occurred to them to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> employ
convicts instead of steam, and thus to combine philanthropy with
business. Difficulties of the usual kind arose as to the procurement
of a suitable site. The site secured under the provisions of the 'Hard
Labour Bill' was for some reason rejected; and Bentham was almost in
despair. It was not until 1799 that he at last acquired for &pound;12,000 an
estate at Millbank, which seemed to be suitable. Meanwhile Bentham had
found another application for his principle. The growth of pauperism
was alarming statesmen. Whitbread proposed in February 1796 to fix a
minimum rate of wages. The wisest thing that government could do, he
said, was to 'offer a liberal premium for the encouragement of large
families.' Pitt proceeded to prepare the abortive Poor-law Bill,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
upon which Bentham (in February 1797) sent in some very shrewd
criticisms. They were not published, but are said to have 'powerfully
contributed to the abandonment of the measure.'<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> They show
Bentham's power of incisive criticism, though they scarcely deal with
the general principle. In the following autumn Bentham contributed to
Arthur Young's <i>Annals of Agriculture</i> upon the same topic. It had
struck him that an application of his Panopticon would give the
required panacea. He worked out details with his usual zeal, and the
scheme attracted notice among the philanthropists of the time. It was
to be a 'succedaneum' to Pitt's proposal. Meanwhile the finance
committee, appointed in 1797, heard evidence from Bentham's friend,
Patrick Colquhoun, upon the Panopticon, and a report recommending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
it
was proposed by R. Pole Carew, a friend of Samuel Bentham. Although
this report was suppressed, the scheme apparently received an impetus.
The Millbank estate was bought in consequence of these proceedings,
and a sum of only &pound;1000 was wanted to buy out the tenant of one piece
of land. Bentham was constantly in attendance at a public office,
expecting a final warrant for the money. It never came, and, as
Bentham believed, the delay was due to the malice of George <small>III.</small> Had
any other king been on the throne, Panopticon in both 'the prisoner
branch and the pauper branch' would have been set at work.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Such
are the consequences of newspaper controversies with monarchs! After
this, in any case, the poor Panopticon, as the old lawyers said,
'languishing did live,' and at last 'languishing did die.' Poor
Bentham seems to have struggled vainly for a time. He appealed to
Pitt's friend, Wilberforce; he appealed to his step-brother Abbot; he
wrote to members of parliament, but all was in vain.</p>

<p>Romilly induced him in 1802 to suppress a statement of his grievances
which could only have rendered ministers implacable.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> But he found
out what would hardly have been a discovery to most people, that
officials can be dilatory and evasive; and certain discoveries about
the treatment of convicts in New South Wales convinced him that they
could even defy the laws and the Constitution when they were beyond
inspection. He published (1803) a <i>Plea for the Constitution</i>, showing
the enormities committed in the colony, 'in breach of Magna Charta,
the Petition of Right, the Habeas Corpus Act, and the Bill of Rights.'
Romilly in vain told him that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
attorney-general could not
recommend the author of such an effusion to be keeper of a
Panopticon.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The actual end did not come till 1811. A committee
then reported against the scheme. They noticed one essential and very
characteristic weakness. The whole system turned upon the profit to be
made from the criminals' labour by Bentham and his brother. The
committee observed that, however unimpeachable might be the characters
of the founders, the scheme might lead to abuses in the hands of their
successors. The adoption of this principle of 'farming' had in fact
led to gross abuses both in gaols and in workhouses; but it was, as I
have said, in harmony with the whole 'individualist' theory. The
committee recommended a different plan; and the result was the
foundation of Millbank penitentiary, opened in 1816.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Bentham
ultimately received &pound;23,000 by way of compensation in 1813.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> The
objections of the committee would now be a commonplace, but Bentham
saw in them another proof of the desire to increase government
patronage. He was well out of the plan. There were probably few men in
England less capable of managing a thousand convicts, in spite of his
theories about 'springs of action.' If anything else had been required
to ensure failure, it would have been association with a sanguine
inventor of brilliant abilities.</p>

<p>Bentham's agitation had not been altogether fruitless. His plan had
been partly adopted at Edinburgh by one of the Adams,<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> and his
work formed an important stage in the development of the penal system.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Bentham, though he could not see that his failure was a blessing in
disguise, had learned one lesson worth learning. He was ill-treated,
according to impartial observers. 'Never,' says Wilberforce,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> 'was
any one worse used. I have seen the tears run down the cheeks of that
strong-minded man through vexation at the pressing importunity of his
creditors, and the indolence of official underlings when day after day
he was begging at the Treasury for what was indeed a mere matter of
right.' Wilberforce adds that Bentham was 'quite soured,' and
attributes his later opinions to this cause. When the <i>Quarterly
Review</i> long afterwards taunted him as a disappointed man, Bentham
declared himself to be in 'a state of perpetual and unruffled gaiety,'
and the 'mainspring' of the gaiety of his own circle.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> No one,
indeed, could be less 'soured' so far as his habitual temper was
concerned. But Wilberforce's remark contained a serious truth. Bentham
had made a discovery. He had vowed war in his youth against the 'demon
of chicane.' He had now learned that the name of the demon was
'Legion.' To cast him out, it would be necessary to cast out the demon
of officialism; and we shall see what this bit of knowledge presently
implied.</p>

<p class="scs">IV. <a name="V_IV" id="V_IV"></a>THE UTILITARIAN PROPAGANDA</p>

<p>Bentham in 1802 had reached the respectable age of fifty-four. He had
published his first work twenty-six years, and his most elaborate
treatise thirteen years, previously. He had been brought into contact
with many of the eminent politicians and philanthropists of the day.
Lansdowne had been a friendly patron: his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
advice had been treated
with respect by Pitt, Dundas, and even by Blackstone; he was on
friendly terms with Colquhoun, Sir F. Eden, Arthur Young, Wilberforce,
and others interested in philanthropic movements, and his name at
least was known to some French politicians. But his reputation was
still obscure; and his connections did not develop into intimacies. He
lived as a recluse and avoided society. His introduction to great
people at Bowood had apparently rather increased than softened his
shyness. The little circle of intimates, Romilly and Wilson and his
own brother, must have satisfied his needs for social intercourse. It
required an elaborate negotiation to bring about a meeting between him
and Dr. Parr, the great Whig prophet, although they had been
previously acquainted, and Parr was, as Romilly said by way of
introduction, a profound admirer and universal panegyrist.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> He
refused to be introduced by Parr to Fox, because he had 'nothing
particular to say' to the statesman, and considered that to be 'always
a sufficient reason for declining acquaintance.'<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>But, at last, Bentham's fame was to take a start. Bentham, I said, had
long before found himself. Dumont had now found Bentham. After long
and tedious labours and multiplied communications between the master
and the disciple, Dumont in the spring of 1802 brought out his
<i>Trait&eacute;s de L&eacute;gislation de M. J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Bentham</i>. The book was partly a
translation from Bentham's published and unpublished works,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> and
partly a statement of the pith of the new doctrine in Dumont's own
language. It had the great merit of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
putting Bentham's meaning
vigorously and compactly, and free from many of the digressions,
minute discussions of minor points and arguments requiring a special
knowledge of English law, which had impeded the popularity of
Bentham's previous works.</p>

<p>The Jacobin controversies were passing into the background: and
Bentham began to attain a hearing as a reformer upon different lines.
In 1803 Dumont visited St. Petersburg, and sent home glowing reports
of Bentham's rising fame. As many copies of the <i>Trait&eacute;s</i> had been
sold there as in London. Codes were wanted; laws were being digested;
and Bentham's work would supply the principles and the classification.
A magnificent translation was ordered, and Russian officials wrote
glowing letters in which Bentham was placed in a line with Bacon,
Newton, and Adam Smith&mdash;each the founder of a new science.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> At
home the new book was one of the objects of what Dumont calls the
'scandalous irreverence' of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> This refers
to a review of the <i>Trait&eacute;s</i> in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> of April 1804.
Although patronising in tone, and ridiculing some of Bentham's
doctrines as commonplace and condemning others as criminal, it paid
some high compliments to his ability. The irreverence meant at least
that Bentham had become one of the persons worth talking about, and
that he was henceforth to influence the rising generation. In January
1807 the <i>Edinburgh</i> itself (probably Jeffrey) suggested that Bentham
should be employed in a proposed reform of the Scottish judicial
system. His old friend, Lansdowne, died on 7th May 1805, and in one of
his last letters expresses a hope that Bentham's principles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> are at
last beginning to spread.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> The hope was fulfilled.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century Benthamism had gone through its period
of incubation. It was now to become an active agency, to gather
proselytes, and to have a marked influence not only upon legislative
but upon political movements. The immediate effect upon Bentham of the
decline of the Panopticon, and his consequent emancipation from
immediately practical work, was apparently his return to his more
legitimate employment of speculative labour. He sent to Dumont at St.
Petersburg<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> part of the treatise upon Political Economy, which had
been naturally suggested by his later work: and he applied himself to
the Scottish judiciary question, to which many of his speculations had
a close application. He published a work upon this subject in 1808. To
the period between 1802 and 1812 belongs also the book, or rather the
collection of papers, afterwards transformed into the book, upon
Evidence, which is one of his most valuable performances.</p>

<p>A letter, dated 1st November 1810, gives a characteristic account of
his position. He refers to hopes of the acceptance of some of his
principles in South America. In Spain Spaniards are prepared to
receive his laws 'as oracles.' 'Now at length, when I am just ready to
drop into the grave' (he had still twenty years of energetic work
before him), 'my fame has spread itself all over the civilised world.'
Dumont's publication of 1802 is considered to have superseded all
previous writings on legislation. In Germany and France codes have
been prepared by authorised lawyers, who have 'sought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> to do
themselves credit by references to that work.'<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> It has been
translated into Russian. Even in England he is often mentioned in
books and in parliament. 'Meantime I am here scribbling on in my
hermitage, never seeing anybody but for some special reason, always
bearing relation to the service of mankind.'<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Making all due
allowance for the deceptive views of the outer world which haunt every
'hermitage,' it remains true that Bentham's fame was emerging from
obscurity.</p>

<p>The end of this period, moreover, was bringing him into closer contact
with English political life. Bentham, as we have seen, rejected the
whole Jacobin doctrine of abstract rights. So long as English politics
meant either the acceptance of a theory which, for whatever reason,
gathered round it no solid body of support, or, on the other hand, the
acceptance of an obstructive and purely conservative principle, to
which all reform was radically opposed, Bentham was necessarily in an
isolated position. He had 'nothing particular to say' to Fox. He was
neither a Tory nor a Jacobin, and cared little for the paralysed
Whigs. He allied himself therefore, so far as he was allied with any
one, with the philanthropic agitators who stood, like him, outside the
lines of party. The improvement of prisons was not a party question. A
marked change&mdash;not always, I think, sufficiently emphasised by
historians&mdash;had followed the second war. The party-divisions began to
take the form which was to become more marked as time went on. The old
issues between Jacobin and Anti-Jacobin no longer existed. Napoleon
had become the heir of the revolution. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> great struggle was
beginning in which England commanded the ocean, while the Continent
was at the feet of the empire. For a time the question was whether
England, too, should be invaded. After Trafalgar invasion became
hopeless. The Napoleonic victories threatened to exclude English trade
from the Continent: while England retorted by declaring that the
Continent should trade with nobody else. Upon one side the war was now
appealing to higher feelings. It was no longer a crusade against
theories, but a struggle for national existence and for the existence
of other nations threatened by a gigantic despotism. Men like
Wordsworth and Coleridge, who could not be Anti-Jacobins, had been
first shocked by the Jacobin treatment of Switzerland, and now threw
themselves enthusiastically into the cause which meant the rescue of
Spain and Germany from foreign oppression. The generous feeling which
had resented the attempt to forbid Frenchmen to break their own bonds,
now resented the attempts of Frenchmen to impose bonds upon others.
The patriotism which prompted to a crusade had seemed unworthy, but
the patriotism which was now allied with the patriotism of Spain and
Germany involved no sacrifice of other sentiment. Many men had
sympathised with the early revolution, not so much from any strong
sentiment of evils at home as from a belief that the French movement
was but a fuller development of the very principles which were
partially embodied in the British Constitution. They had no longer to
choose between sympathising with the enemies of England and
sympathising with the suppressors of the old English liberties.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, an opposite change took
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> place. The
disappearance of the Jacobin movement allowed the Radicalism of home
growth to display itself more fully. English Whigs of all shades had
opposed the war with certain misgivings. They had been nervously
anxious not to identify themselves with the sentiments of the
Jacobins. They desired peace with the French, but had to protest that
it was not for love of French principles. That difficulty was removed.
There was no longer a vision&mdash;such as Gillray had embodied in his
caricatures&mdash;of a guillotine in St. James's Street: or of a Committee
of Public Safety formed by Fox, Paine, and Horne Tooke. Meanwhile Whig
prophecies of the failure of the war were not disproved by its
results. Though the English navy had been victorious, English
interference on the Continent had been futile. Millions of money had
been wasted: and millions were flowing freely. Even now we stand
astonished at the reckless profusion of the financiers of the time.
And what was there to show for it? The French empire, so far from
being destroyed, had been consolidated. If we escaped for the time,
could we permanently resist the whole power of Europe? When the
Peninsular War began we had been fighting, except for the short truce
of Amiens, for sixteen years; and there seemed no reason to believe
that the expedition to Portugal in 1808 would succeed better than
previous efforts. The Walcheren expedition of 1809 was a fresh proof
of our capacity for blundering. Pauperism was still increasing
rapidly, and forebodings of a war with America beginning to trouble
men interested in commerce. The English Opposition had ample texts for
discourses; and a demand for change began to spring up which was no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
longer a reflection of foreign sympathies. An article in the
<i>Edinburgh</i> of January 1808, which professed to demonstrate the
hopelessness of the Peninsular War, roused the wrath of the Tories.
The <i>Quarterly Review</i> was started by Canning and Scott, and the
<i>Edinburgh</i>, in return, took a more decidedly Whig colour. The
Radicals now showed themselves behind the Whigs. Cobbett, who had been
the most vigorous of John Bull Anti-Jacobins, was driven by his hatred
of the tax-gatherer and the misery of the agricultural labourers into
the opposite camp, and his <i>Register</i> became the most effective organ
of Radicalism. Demands for reform began again to make themselves heard
in parliament. Sir Francis Burdett, who had sat at the feet of Horne
Tooke, and whose return with Cochrane for Westminster in 1807 was the
first parliamentary triumph of the reformers, proposed a motion on
15th June 1809, which was, of course, rejected, but which was the
first of a series, and marked the revival of a serious agitation not
to cease till the triumph of 1832.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bentham, meditating profoundly upon the Panopticon, had at
last found out that he had begun at the wrong end. His reasoning had
been thrown away upon the huge dead weight of official indifference,
or worse than indifference. Why did they not accept the means for
producing the greatest happiness of the greatest number? Because
statesmen did not desire the end. And why not? To answer that
question, and to show how a government could be constructed which
should desire it, became a main occupation of Bentham's life.
Henceforward, therefore, instead of merely treating of penal codes and
other special reforms, his attention is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> directed to the previous
question of political organisation; while at times he diverges to
illustrate incidentally the abuses of what he ironically calls the
'matchless constitution.' Bentham's principal occupation, in a word,
was to provide political philosophy for radical reformers.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>Bentham remained as much a recluse as ever. He seldom left Queen's
Square Place except for certain summer outings. In 1807 he took a
house at Barrow Green, near Oxted, in Surrey, lying in a picturesque
hollow at the foot of the chalk hills.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> It was an old-fashioned
house, standing in what had been a park, with a lake and a comfortable
kitchen garden. Bentham pottered about in the grounds and under the
old chestnut-trees, codifying, gardening, and talking to occasional
disciples. He returned thither in following years; but in 1814,
probably in consequence of his compensation for the Panopticon, took a
larger place, Ford Abbey, near Chard in Somersetshire. It was a superb
residence,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> with chapel, cloisters, and corridors, a hall eighty
feet long by thirty high, and a great dining parlour. Parts of the
building dated from the twelfth century or the time of the
Commonwealth, or had undergone alterations attributed to Inigo Jones.
No Squire Western could have cared less for antiquarian associations,
but Bentham made a very fair monk. The place, for which he paid &pound;315 a
year, was congenial. He rode his favourite hobby of gardening, and
took his regular 'ante-jentacular' and 'post-prandial' walks, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
played battledore and shuttlecock in the intervals of codification. He
liked it so well that he would have taken it for life, but for the
loss of &pound;8000 or &pound;10,000 in a Devonshire marble-quarry.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> In 1818
he gave it up, and thenceforward rarely quitted Queen's Square Place.
His life was varied by few incidents, although his influence upon
public affairs was for the first time becoming important. The busier
journalists and platform orators did not trouble themselves much about
philosophy. But they were in communication with men of a higher stamp,
Romilly, James Mill, and others, who formed Bentham's innermost
council. Thus the movements in the outside world set up an agitation
in Bentham's study; and the recluse was prompted to set himself to
work upon elaborating his own theories in various directions, in order
to supply the necessary substratum of philosophical doctrine. If he
had not the power of gaining the public ear, his oracles were
transmitted through the disciples who also converted some of his raw
materials into coherent books.</p>

<p>The most important of Bentham's disciples for many years was James
Mill, and I shall have to say what more is necessary in regard to the
active agitation when I speak of Mill himself. For the present, it is
enough to say that Mill first became Bentham's proselyte about 1808.
Mill stayed with Bentham at Barrow Green and at Ford Abbey. Though
some differences caused superficial disturbances of their harmony, no
prophet could have had a more zealous, uncompromising, and vigorous
disciple. Mill's force of character qualified him to become the leader
of the school; but his doctrine was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
always essentially the doctrine
of Bentham, and for the present he was content to be the transmitter
of his master's message to mankind. He was at this period a
contributor to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>; and in October 1809 he inserted
some praises of Bentham in a review of a book upon legislation by S.
Scipion Bexon. The article was cruelly mangled by Jeffrey, according
to his custom, and Jeffrey's most powerful vassal, Brougham, thought
that the praises which remained were excessive.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>Obviously the orthodox Whigs were not prepared to swear allegiance to
Bentham. He was drawing into closer connection with the Radicals. In
1809 Cobbett was denouncing the duke of York in consequence of the
Mrs. Clarke scandal. Bentham wrote to him, but anonymously and
cautiously, to obtain documents in regard to a previous libel
case,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> and proceeded to write a pamphlet on the <i>Elements of the
Art of Packing (as applied to Special Juries)</i>, so sharp that his
faithful adviser, Romilly, procured its suppression for the time.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
Copies, however, were printed and privately given to a few who could
be trusted. Bentham next wrote (1809) a 'Catechism of Parliamentary
Reform,' which he communicated to Cobbett (16th November 1810), with a
request for its publication in the <i>Register</i>.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Cobbett was at
this time in prison for his attack upon flogging militia men; and,
though still more hostile to government, was bound to be more cautious
in his line of assault. The plan was not published, whether because
too daring or too dull; but it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> apparently printed. Bentham's
opinion of Cobbett was anything but flattering. Cobbett, he thought in
1812, was a 'vile rascal,' and was afterwards pronounced to be 'filled
with the <i>odium humani generis</i>&mdash;his malevolence and lying beyond
everything.'<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Cobbett's radicalism, in fact, was of the type most
hostile to the Utilitarians. John Hunt, in the <i>Examiner</i>, was
'trumpeting' Bentham and Romilly in 1812, and was praised
accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Bentham formed an alliance with another leading
Radical. He had made acquaintance by 1811 with Sir F. Burdett, to whom
he then appealed for help in an attack upon the delays of
Chancery.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Burdett, indeed, appeared to him to be far inferior to
Romilly and Brougham, but he thought that so powerful a 'hero of the
mob' ought to be turned to account in the good cause.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Burdett
seems to have courted the old philosopher; and a few years later a
closer alliance was brought about. The peace of 1815 was succeeded by
a period of distress, the more acutely felt from the disappointment of
natural hopes of prosperity; and a period of agitation, met by harsh
repression, followed. Applications were made, to Bentham for
permission to use his 'Catechism,' which was ultimately published
(1818) in a cheap form by Wooler, well known as the editor of the
democratic <i>Black Dwarf</i>.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Burdett applied for a plan of
parliamentary reform. Henry Bickersteth (1783-1851), afterwards Lord
Langdale and Master of the Rolls, at this time a rising barrister of
high character, wrote an appeal to Bentham and Burdett to combine in
setting forth a scheme which, with such authority, must command
general acceptance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
The result was a series of resolutions moved by
Burdett in the House of Commons on 2nd June 1818,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> demanding
universal suffrage, annual parliaments, and vote by ballot. Bentham
had thus accepted the conclusions reached in a different way by the
believers in that 'hodge-podge' of absurdities, the declaration of the
rights of man. Curiously enough, his assault upon that document
appeared in Dumont's French version in the year 1816, at the very time
when he was accepting its practical conclusions.</p>

<p>The schemes in which Mill was interested at this time drew Bentham's
attention in other directions. In 1813 the Quaker, William Allen, who
had been a close ally of Mill, induced Bentham to invest money in the
New Lanark establishment. Owen, whose benevolent schemes had been
hampered by his partners, bought them out, the new capital being
partly provided by Allen, Bentham, and others. Bentham afterwards
spoke contemptuously of Owen, who, as he said, 'began in vapour and
ended in smoke,'<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> and whose disciples came in after years into
sharp conflict with the Utilitarians. Bentham, however, took pleasure,
it seems, in Owen's benevolent schemes for infant education, and made
money by his investment, for once combining business with philanthropy
successfully.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Probably he regarded New Lanark as a kind of
Panopticon. Owen had not as yet become a prophet of Socialism.</p>

<p>Another set of controversies in which Mill and his friends took an
active part, started Bentham in a whole series of speculations. A plan
(which I shall have to mention in connection with Mill), was devised
in 1815
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
for a 'Chrestomathic school,' which was to give a sound
education of proper Utilitarian tendencies to the upper and middle
classes. Brougham, Mackintosh, Ricardo, William Allen, and Place were
all interested in this undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Bentham offered a site at
Queen's Square Place, and though the scheme never came to the birth,
it set him actively at work. He wrote a series of papers during his
first year at Ford Abbey<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> upon the theory of education, published
in 1816 as <i>Chrestomathia</i>; and to this was apparently due a further
excursion beyond the limits of jurisprudence. Educational controversy
in that ignorant day was complicated by religious animosity; the
National Society and the 'British and Foreign' Society were fighting
under the banners of Bell and Lancaster, and the war roused excessive
bitterness. Bentham finding the church in his way, had little
difficulty in discovering that the whole ecclesiastical system was
part of the general complex of abuse against which he was warring. He
fell foul of the Catechism; he exposed the abuses of non-residence and
episcopal wealth; he discovered that the Thirty-nine Articles
contained gross fallacies; he went on to make an onslaught upon the
Apostle St Paul, whose evidence as to his conversion was exposed to a
severe cross-examination; and, finally, he wrote, or supplied the
materials for, a remarkable <i>Analysis of Natural Religion</i>, which was
ultimately published by Grote under the pseudonym 'Philip Beauchamp,'
in 1822. This procedure from the particular case of the Catechism in
schools up to the general problem of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> utility of religion in
general, is curiously characteristic of Bentham.</p>

<p>Bentham's mind was attracted to various other schemes by the disciples
who came to sit at his feet, and professed, with more or less
sincerity, to regard him as a Solon. Foreigners had been resorting to
him from all parts of the world, and gave him hopes of new fields for
codifying. As early as 1808 he had been visited at Barrow Green by the
strange adventurer, politician, lawyer, and filibuster, Aaron Burr,
famous for the duel in which he killed Alexander Hamilton, and now
framing wild schemes for an empire in Mexico. Unscrupulous, restlessly
active and cynical, he was a singular contrast to the placid
philosopher, upon whom his confidences seem to have made an impression
of not unpleasing horror. Burr's conversation suggested to Bentham a
singular scheme for emigrating to Mexico. He applied seriously for
introductions to Lord Holland, who had passed some time in Spain, and
to Holland's friend, Jovellanos (1749-1812), a member of the Spanish
Junta, who had written treatises upon legislation (1785), of which
Bentham approved.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> The dream of Mexico was succeeded by a dream of
Venezuela. General Miranda spent some years in England, and had become
well known to James Mill. He was now about to start upon an
unfortunate expedition to Venezuela, his native country. He took with
him a draft of a law for the freedom of the press, which Bentham drew
up, and he proposed that when his new state was founded, Bentham
should be its legislator.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Miranda was betrayed to the Spanish
government in 1812, and died (1816) in the hands of the Inquisition.
Bolivar,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
who was also in London in 1810 and took some notice of
Joseph Lancaster, applied in flattering terms to Bentham. Long
afterwards, when dictator of Columbia, he forbade the use of Bentham's
works in the schools, to which, however, the privilege of reading him
was restored, and, let us hope, duly valued, in 1835.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Santander,
another South American hero, was also a disciple, and encouraged the
study of Bentham. Bentham says in 1830 that forty thousand copies of
Dumont's <i>Trait&eacute;s</i> had been sold in Paris for the South American
trade.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> What share Bentham may have had in modifying South
American ideas is unknown to me. In the United States he had many
disciples of a more creditable kind than Burr. He appealed in 1811 to
Madison, then President, for permission to construct a 'Pannomion' or
complete body of law, for the use of the United States; and urged his
claims both upon Madison and the Governor of Pennsylvania in 1817,
when peace had been restored. He had many conversations upon this
project with John Quincy Adams, who was then American minister in
England.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> This, of course, came to nothing, but an eminent
American disciple, Edward Livingston (1764-1836), between 1820 and
1830 prepared codes for the State of Louisiana, and warmly
acknowledged his obligations to Bentham.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> In 1830 Bentham also
acknowledges a notice of his labours, probably resulting from this,
which had been made in one of General Jackson's presidential
messages.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> In his later years the United States became his ideal,
and he never tired of comparing its cheap and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
honest enactment with
the corruption and extravagance at home.</p>

<p class="scs">V. <a name="V_V" id="V_V"></a>CODIFICATION</p>

<p>The unsettled conditions which followed the peace in various European
countries found Bentham other employment. In 1809 Dumont did some
codifying for the Emperor of Russia, and in 1817 was engaged to do the
same service for Geneva. He was employed for some years, and is said
to have introduced a Benthamite Penal Code and Panopticon, and an
application of the Tactics.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> In 1820 and 1821 Bentham was
consulted by the Constitutional party in Spain and Portugal, and wrote
elaborate tracts for their enlightenment. He made an impression upon
at least one Spaniard. Borrow, when travelling in Spain some ten years
after Bentham's death, was welcomed by an Alcalde on Cape Finisterre,
who had upon his shelves all the works of the 'grand Baintham,' and
compared him to Solon, Plato, and even Lope de Vega.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> The last
comparison appeared to Borrow to be overstrained. Bentham even
endeavoured in 1822-23 to administer some sound advice to the
government of Tripoli, but his suggestions for 'remedies against
misrule' seem never to have been communicated.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> In 1823 and 1824
he was a member of the Greek Committee; he corresponded with
Mavrocordato and other leaders; and he begged Parr to turn some of his
admonitions into 'Parrian' Greek for the benefit of the moderns.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
Blaqui&egrave;re and Stanhope, two ardent members of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
committee, were
disciples; and Stanhope carried with him to Greece Bentham's <i>Table of
the Springs of Action</i>, with which he tried to indoctrinate Byron. The
poet, however, thought with some plausibility that he was a better
judge of human passions than the philosopher. Parry, the engineer, who
joined Byron at the same time, gives a queer account of the old
philosopher trotting about London in the service of the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
The coarse and thoughtless might laugh, and perhaps some neither
coarse nor thoughtless might smile. But Bowring tells us that these
were days of boundless happiness for Bentham.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Tributes of
admiration were pouring in from all sides, and the true Gospel was
spreading across the Atlantic and along the shores of the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>At home the Utilitarian party was consolidating itself; and the
struggle which resulted in the Reform Bill was slowly beginning. The
veteran Cartwright, Bentham's senior by eight years, tried in 1821 to
persuade him to come out as one of a committee of 'Guardians of
Constitutional Reform,' elected at a public meeting.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Bentham
wisely refused to be drawn from his privacy. He left it to his friends
to agitate, while he returned to labour in his study. The demand for
legislation which had sprung up in so many parts of the world
encouraged Bentham to undertake the last of his great labours. The
Portuguese Cortes voted in December 1821 that he should be invited to
prepare an 'all-comprehensive code'; and in 1822 he put out a curious
'Codification proposal,' offering to do the work for any nation in
need of a legislator, and appending testimonials
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
to his competence
for the work. He set to work upon a 'Constitutional Code,' which
occupied him at intervals during the remainder of his life, and
embodied the final outcome of his speculations. He diverged from this
main purpose to write various pamphlets upon topics of immediate
interest; and was keenly interested in the various activities of his
disciples. The Utilitarians now thought themselves entitled to enter
the field of politics as a distinct body. An organ to defend their
cause was desirable, and Bentham supplied the funds for the
<i>Westminster Review</i>, of which the first number appeared in April
1824.</p>

<p>The editorship fell chiefly into the hands of Bowring (1792-1872).
Bowring had travelled much upon the Continent for a commercial house,
and his knowledge of Spanish politics had brought him into connection
with Bentham, to whom Blaqui&egrave;re recommended him in 1820.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> A strong
attachment sprang up between the two. Bentham confided all his
thoughts and feelings to the young man, and Bowring looked up to his
teacher with affectionate reverence. In 1828 Bentham says that Bowring
is 'the most intimate friend he has.'<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Bowring complains of
calumnies, by which he was assailed, though they failed to alienate
Bentham. What they may have been matters little; but it is clear that
a certain jealousy arose between this last disciple and his older
rivals. James Mill's stern and rigid character had evidently produced
some irritation at intervals; and to him it would naturally appear
that Bowring was the object of a senile favouritism. In any case it is
to be regretted that Bentham thus became partly alienated from his
older
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
friends<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>. Mill was too proud to complain; and never wavered
in his allegiance to the master's principles. But one result, and to
us the most important, was that the new attachment led to the
composition of one of the worst biographies in the language, out of
materials which might have served for a masterpiece. Bowring was a
great linguist, and an energetic man of business. He wrote hymns, and
one of them, 'In the cross of Christ I glory,' is said to have
'universal fame.' A Benthamite capable of so singular an eccentricity
judiciously agreed to avoid discussions upon religious topics with his
master. To Bowring we also owe the <i>Deontology</i>, which professes to
represent Bentham's dictation. The Mills repudiated this version,
certainly a very poor one, of their teacher's morality, and held that
it represented less Bentham than such an impression of Bentham as
could be stamped upon a muddle-headed disciple.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>The last years of his life brought Bentham into closer connection with
more remarkable men. The Radicals had despised the Whigs as trimmers
and half-hearted reformers, and James Mill expressed this feeling very
frankly in the first numbers of the <i>Westminster Review</i>. Reform,
however, was now becoming respectable, and the Whigs were gaining the
courage to take it up seriously. Foremost among the Edinburgh
Reviewers was the great Henry Brougham, whose fame was at this time
almost as great as his ambition could desire, and who considered
himself to be the natural leader of all reform. He had shown eagerness
to distinguish himself in lines fully
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
approved by Bentham. His
admirers regarded him as a giant; and his opponents, if they saw in
him a dash of the charlatan, could not deny his amazing energy and his
capacity as an orator. The insatiable vanity which afterwards ruined
his career already made it doubtful whether he fought for the cause or
the glory. But he was at least an instrument worth having. He was a
kind of half-disciple. If in 1809 he had checked Mill's praise of
Bentham, he was soon afterwards in frequent communication with the
master. In July 1812 Bentham announces that Brougham is at last to be
admitted to a dinner, for which he had been 'intriguing any time this
six months,' and expects that his proselyte will soon be the first man
in the House of Commons, and eclipse even Romilly.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> In later years
they had frequent communications; and when in 1827 Brougham was known
to be preparing an utterance upon law reform, Bentham's hopes rose
high. He offered to his disciple 'some nice little sweet pap of my own
making,' sound teaching that is, upon evidence, judicial
establishments and codification. Brougham thanks his 'dear grandpapa,'
and Bentham offers further supplies to his 'dear, sweet little
poppet.'<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> But when the orator had spoken Bentham declares (9th
February 1828) that the mountain has been delivered of a mouse.
Brougham was 'not the man to set up' simple and rational principles.
He was the sham adversary but the real accomplice of Peel, pulling up
lies by the root to plant others equally noxious.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> In 1830 Bentham
had even to hold up 'Master Peel' as a 'model good boy' to the
self-styled reformer. Brougham needs a dose of jalap instead of pap,
for he cannot even spell the 'greatest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
happiness principle'
properly.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Bentham went so far as to write what he fondly took to
be an epigram upon Brougham:</p>

<div class="centered table">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="60%" cellspacing="0" summary="POEM">
<tr><td>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'So foolish and so wise, so great, so small,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>In September 1831 Brougham as Chancellor announced a scheme for
certain changes in the constitution of the courts. The proposal called
forth Bentham's last pamphlet, <i>Lord Brougham displayed</i>.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Bentham
laments that his disciple has 'stretched out the right hand of
fellowship to jobbers of all sorts.'<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> In vain had Brougham in his
speech called Bentham 'one of the great sages of the law.' Bentham
acknowledges his amiability and his genius; but laments over the
untrustworthy character of a man who could only adopt principles so
far as they were subservient to his own vanity.</p>

<p>Another light of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, who at this time took
Brougham at his own valuation, did an incidental service to Bentham.
Upon the publication of the <i>Book of Fallacies</i> in 1825, Sydney Smith
reviewed or rather condensed it in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and gave
the pith of the whole in his famous <i>Noodle's Oration</i>. The noodle
utters all the commonplaces by which the stupid conservatives, with
Eldon at their head, met the demands of reformers. Nothing could be
wittier than Smith's brilliant summary. Whigs and Radicals for the
time agreed in ridiculing blind prejudice. The day was to come when
the Whigs at least would see that some principles might be worse than
prejudice. All the fools, said Lord Melbourne, 'were against Catholic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Emancipation, and the worst of it is, the fools were in the right.'
Sydney Smith was glad to be Bentham's mouthpiece for the moment:
though, when Benthamism was applied to church reform, Smith began to
perceive that Noodle was not so silly as he seemed.</p>

<p>One other ally of Bentham deserves notice. O'Connell had in 1828, in
speaking of legal abuses, called himself 'an humble disciple of the
immortal Bentham.'<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> Bentham wrote to acknowledge the compliment.
He invited O'Connell to become an inmate of his hermitage at Queen's
Square Place, and O'Connell responded warmly to the letters of his
'revered master.' Bentham's aversion to Catholicism was as strong as
his objection to Catholic disqualifications, and he took some trouble
to smooth down the difficulties which threatened an alliance between
ardent believers and thoroughgoing sceptics. O'Connell had attacked
some who were politically upon his side. 'Dan, dear child,' says
Bentham, 'whom in imagination I am at this moment pressing to my fond
bosom, put off, if it be possible, your intolerance.'<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Their
friendship, however, did not suffer from this discord, and their
correspondence is in the same tone till the end. In one of Bentham's
letters he speaks of a contemporary correspondence with another great
man, whom he does not appear to have met personally. He was writing
long letters, entreating the duke of Wellington to eclipse Cromwell by
successfully attacking the lawyers. The duke wrote 'immediate answers
in his own hand,' and took good-humouredly a remonstrance from Bentham
upon the duel with Lord Winchilsea in 1829.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Bentham was ready to
the end to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
seek allies in any quarter. When Lord Sidmouth took office
in 1812, Bentham had an interview with him, and had some hopes of
being employed to prepare a penal code.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Although experience had
convinced him of the futility of expectations from the Sidmouths and
Eldons, he was always on the look out for sympathy; and the venerable
old man was naturally treated with respect by people who had little
enough of real interest in his doctrines.</p>

<p>During the last ten years of his life, Bentham was cheered by symptoms
of the triumph of his creed. The approach of the millennium seemed to
be indicated by the gathering of the various forces which carried
Roman Catholic Emancipation and the Reform Bill. Bentham still
received testimonies of his fame abroad. In 1825 he visited Paris to
consult some physicians. He was received with the respect which the
French can always pay to intellectual eminence.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> All the lawyers
in a court of justice rose to receive him, and he was placed at the
president's right hand. On the revolution of 1830, he addressed some
good advice to the country of which he had been made a citizen nearly
forty years before. In 1832, Talleyrand, to whom he had talked about
the Panopticon in 1792, dined with him alone in his hermitage.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
When Bowring observed to the prince that Bentham's works had been
plundered, the polite diplomatist replied, <i>et pill&eacute; de tout le monde,
il est toujours riche</i>. Bentham was by this time failing. At
eighty-two he was still, as he put it, 'codifying like any
dragon.'<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> On 18th May 1832 he did his last bit of his lifelong
labour, upon the 'Constitutional Code.' The great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
reform agitation
was reaching the land of promise, but Bentham was to die in the
wilderness. He sank without a struggle on 6th June 1832, his head
resting on Bowring's bosom. He left the characteristic direction that
his body should be dissected for the benefit of science. An incision
was formally made; and the old gentleman, in his clothes as he lived,
his face covered by a wax mask, is still to be seen at University
College in Gower Street.</p>

<p>Bentham, as we are told, had a strong personal resemblance to Benjamin
Franklin. Sagacity, benevolence, and playfulness were expressed in
both physiognomies. Bentham, however, differed from the man whose
intellect presents many points of likeness, in that he was not a man
of the market-place or the office. Bentham was in many respects a
child through life:<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> a child in simplicity, good humour, and
vivacity; his health was unbroken; he knew no great sorrow; and after
emerging from the discouragement of his youth, he was placidly
contemplating a continuous growth of fame and influence. He is said to
have expressed the wish that he could awake once in a century to
contemplate the prospect of a world gradually adopting his principles
and so making steady progress in happiness and wisdom.</p>

<p>No man could lead a simpler life. His chief luxuries at table were
fruit, bread, and tea. He had a 'sacred teapot' called Dick, with
associations of its own, and carefully regulated its functions. He
refrained from wine during the greatest part of his life, and was
never guilty of a single act of intemperance. In later life he took a
daily half-glass of Madeira. He was scrupulously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
neat in person, and
wore a Quaker-like brown coat, brown cassimere breeches, white worsted
stockings and a straw hat. He walked or 'rather trotted' with his
stick Dapple, and took his 'ante-prandial' and other 'circumgyrations'
with absolute punctuality. He loved pets; he had a series of attached
cats; and cherished the memory of a 'beautiful pig' at Hendon, and of
a donkey at Ford Abbey. He encouraged mice to play in his study&mdash;a
taste which involved some trouble with his cats, and suggests problems
as to the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Kindness to
animals was an essential point of his moral creed. 'I love
everything,' he said, 'that has four legs.' He had a passion for
flowers, and tried to introduce useful plants. He loved
music&mdash;especially Handel&mdash;and had an organ in his house. He cared
nothing for poetry: 'Prose,' he said,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> 'is when all the lines
except the last go on to the margin. Poetry is when some of them fall
short of it.' He was courteous and attentive to his guests, though
occasionally irritable when his favourite crotchets were transgressed,
or especially if his fixed hours of work were deranged.</p>

<p>His regularity in literary work was absolute. He lived by a
time-table, working in the morning and turning out from ten to fifteen
folio pages daily. He read the newspapers regularly, but few books,
and cared nothing for criticisms on his own writings. His only
substantial meal was a dinner at six or half-past, to which he
occasionally admitted a few friends as a high privilege. He liked to
discuss the topics of which his mind was full, and made notes
beforehand of particular points to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
be introduced in conversation. He
was invariably inaccessible to visitors, even famous ones, likely to
distract his thoughts. 'Tell Mr. Bentham that Mr. Richard Lovell
Edgeworth desires to see him.' 'Tell Mr. Richard Lovell Edgeworth that
Mr. Bentham does not desire to see him' was the reply. When Mme. de
Sta&euml;l came to England, she said to Dumont: 'Tell Bentham I shall see
nobody till I have seen him.' 'I am sorry for it,' said Bentham, 'for
then she will never see anybody.' And he summed up his opinion of the
famous author of <i>Corinne</i> by calling her 'a trumpery magpie.'<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
There is a simplicity and vivacity about some of the sayings reported
by Bowring, which prove that Bentham could talk well, and increase our
regret for the absence of a more efficient Boswell. At ten Bentham had
his tea, at eleven his nightcap, and by twelve all his guests were
ignominiously expelled. He was left to sleep on a hard bed. His sleep
was light, and much disturbed by dreams.</p>

<p>Bentham was certainly amiable. The 'surest way to gain men,' he said,
'is to appear to love them, and the surest way to appear to love them
is to love them in reality.' The least pleasing part of his character,
however, is the apparent levity of his attachments. He was, as we have
seen, partly alienated from Dumont, though some friendly
communications are recorded in later years, and Dumont spoke warmly of
Bentham only a few days before his death in 1829.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> He not only
cooled towards James Mill, but, if Bowring is to be trusted, spoke of
him with great harshness.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Bowring was not a judicious reporter,
indeed, and capable of taking hasty phrases too seriously. What
Bentham's remarks upon these and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
other friends suggest is not malice
or resentment, but the flippant utterance of a man whose feelings are
wanting in depth rather than kindliness. It is noticeable that, after
his early visit at Bowood, no woman seems to have counted for anything
in Bentham's life. He was not only never in love, but it looks as if
he never even talked to any woman except his cook or housemaid.</p>

<p>The one conclusion that I need draw concerns a question not, I think,
hard to be solved. It would be easy to make a paradox by calling
Bentham at once the most practical and most unpractical of men. This
is to point out the one-sided nature of Bentham's development.
Bentham's habits remind us in some ways of Kant; and the thought may
be suggested that he would have been more in his element as a German
professor of philosophies. In such a position he might have devoted
himself to the delight of classifying and co-ordinating theories, and
have found sufficient enjoyment in purely intellectual activity. After
a fashion that was the actual result. How far, indeed, Bentham could
have achieved much in the sphere of pure philosophy, and what kind of
philosophy he would have turned out, must be left to conjecture. The
circumstances of his time and country, and possibly his own
temperament generally, turned his thoughts to problems of legislation
and politics, that is to say, of direct practical interest. He was
therefore always dealing with concrete facts, and a great part of his
writings may be considered as raw material for acts of parliament.
Bentham remained, however, unpractical, in the sense that he had not
that knowledge which we ascribe either to the poet or to the man of
the world. He had neither the passion nor the sympathetic imagination.
The springs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
of active conduct which Byron knew from experience were
to Bentham nothing more than names in a careful classification. Any
shrewd attorney or Bow Street runner would have been a better judge of
the management of convicts; and here were dozens of party politicians,
such as Rigby and Barr&eacute;, who could have explained to him beforehand
those mysteries in the working of the political machinery, which it
took him half a lifetime to discover. In this sense Bentham was
unpractical in the highest degree, for at eighty he had not found out
of what men are really made. And yet by his extraordinary intellectual
activity and the concentration of all his faculties upon certain
problems, he succeeded in preserving an example, and though not a
unique yet an almost unsurpassable example, of the power which belongs
to the man of one idea.</p>

<h3>BENTHAM'S DOCTRINE</h3>

<p class="scs">I. <a name="VI_I" id="VI_I"></a>FIRST PRINCIPLES</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Bentham's position is in one respect unique. There have been many
greater thinkers; but there has been hardly any one whose abstract
theory has become in the same degree the platform of an active
political party. To accept the philosophy was to be also pledged to
practical applications of Utilitarianism. What, then, was the
revelation made to the Benthamites, and to what did it owe its
influence? The central doctrine is expressed in Bentham's famous
formula: the test of right and wrong is the 'greatest happiness of the
greatest number.' There was nothing new in this assertion. It only
expresses the fact that Bentham accepted one of the two alternatives
which have commended themselves to conflicting schools ever since
ethical speculation was erected into a separate department of thought.
Moreover, the side which Bentham took was, we may say, the winning
side. The ordinary morality of the time was Utilitarian in substance.
Hutcheson had invented the sacred phrase: and Hume had based his moral
system upon 'utility.'<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Bentham
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> had learned much from Helv&eacute;tius
the French freethinker, and had been anticipated by Paley the English
divine. The writings in which Bentham deals explicitly with the
general principles of Ethics would hardly entitle him to a higher
position than that of a disciple of Hume without Hume's subtlety; or
of Paley without Paley's singular gift of exposition. Why, then, did
Bentham's message come upon his disciples with the force and freshness
of a new revelation? Our answer must be in general terms that Bentham
founded not a doctrine but a method: and that the doctrine which came
to him simply as a general principle was in his hands a potent
instrument applied with most fruitful results to questions of
immediate practical interest.</p>

<p>Beyond the general principle of utility, therefore, we have to
consider the 'organon' constructed by him to give effect to a general
principle too vague to be applied in detail. The fullest account of
this is contained in the <i>Introduction to the Principles of Morals and
Legislation</i>. This work unfortunately is a fragment, but it gives his
doctrine vigorously and decisively, without losing itself in the
minute details which become wearisome in his later writings. Bentham
intended it as an introduction to a penal code; and his investigation
sent him back to more general problems. He found it necessary to
settle the relations of the penal code to the whole body of law; and
to settle these he had to consider the principles which underlie
legislation in general. He had thus, he says, to 'create a new
science,' and then to elaborate one department of the science. The
'introduction' would contain prolegomena not only for the penal code
but for the other departments of inquiry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
which he intended to
exhaust.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> He had to lay down primary truths which should be to
this science what the axioms are to mathematical sciences.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> These
truths therefore belong to the sphere of conduct in general, and
include his ethical theory.</p>

<p>'Nature has placed mankind' (that is his opening phrase) 'under the
governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them
alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what
we shall do.' There is the unassailable basis. It had been laid down
as unequivocally by Locke,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> and had been embodied in the brilliant
couplets of Pope's <i>Essay on Man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> At the head of the curious
table of universal knowledge, given in the <i>Chrestomathia</i>, we have
Eud&aelig;monics as an all-comprehensive name of which every art is a
branch.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> Eud&aelig;monics, as an art, corresponds to the science
'ontology.' It covers the whole sphere of human thought. It means
knowledge in general as related to conduct. Its first principle,
again, requires no more proof than the primary axioms of arithmetic or
geometry. Once understood, it is by the same act of the mind seen to
be true. Some people, indeed, do not see it. Bentham rather ignores
than answers some of their arguments. But his mode of treating
opponents indicates his own position. 'Happiness,' it is often said,
is too vague a word to be the keystone of an ethical system; it
varies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
from man to man: or it is 'subjective,' and therefore gives no
absolute or independent ground for morality. A morality of
'eud&aelig;monism' must be an 'empirical' morality, and we can never extort
from it that 'categorical imperative,' without which we have instead
of a true morality a simple system of 'expediency.' From Bentham's
point of view the criticism must be retorted. He regards 'happiness'
as precisely the least equivocal of words; and 'happiness' itself as
therefore affording the one safe clue to all the intricate problems of
human conduct. The authors of the <i>Federalist</i>, for example, had said
that justice was the 'end of government.' 'Why not happiness?' asks
Bentham. 'What happiness is every man knows, because what pleasure is,
every man knows, and what pain is, every man knows. But what justice
is&mdash;this is what on every occasion is the subject-matter of
dispute.'<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> That phrase gives his view in a nutshell. Justice is
the means, not the end. That is just which produces a maximum of
happiness. Omit all reference to Happiness, and Justice becomes a
meaningless word prescribing equality, but not telling us equality of
what. Happiness, on the other hand, has a substantial and independent
meaning from which the meaning of justice can be deduced. It has
therefore a logical priority: and to attempt to ignore this is the way
to all the labyrinths of hopeless confusion by which legislation has
been made a chaos. Bentham's position is indicated by his early
conflict with Blackstone, not a very powerful representative of the
opposite principle. Blackstone, in fact, had tried to base his defence
of that eminently empirical product, the British Constitution,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> upon
some show of a philosophical groundwork. He had used the vague
conception of a 'social contract,' frequently invoked for the same
purpose at the revolution of 1688, and to eke out his arguments
applied the ancient commonplaces about monarchy, aristocracy, and
democracy. He thus tried to invest the constitution with the sanctity
derived from this mysterious 'contract,' while appealing also to
tradition or the incarnate 'wisdom of our ancestors,' as shown by
their judicious mixture of the three forms. Bentham had an easy task,
though he performed it with remarkable vigour, in exposing the
weakness of this heterogeneous aggregate. Look closely, and this
fictitious contract can impose no new obligation: for the obligation
itself rests upon Utility. Why not appeal to Utility at once? I am
bound to obey, not because my great-grandfather may be regarded as
having made a bargain, which he did not really make, with the
great-grandfather of George <small>III.</small>; but simply because rebellion does
more harm than good. The forms of government are abstractions, not
names of realities, and their 'mixture' is a pure figment. King,
Lords, and Commons are not really incarnations of power, wisdom, and
goodness. Their combination forms a system the merits of which must in
the last resort be judged by its working. 'It is the principle of
utility, accurately apprehended and steadily applied, that affords the
only clew to guide a man through these streights.'<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> So much in
fact Bentham might learn from Hume; and to defend upon any other
ground the congeries of traditional arrangements which passed for the
British Constitution was obviously absurd. It was in this warfare
against the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
shifting and ambiguous doctrines of Blackstone that
Bentham first showed the superiority of his own method: for, as
between the two, Bentham's position is at least the most coherent and
intelligible.</p>

<p>Blackstone, however, represents little more than a bit of rhetoric
embodying fragments of inconsistent theories. The <i>Morals and
Legislation</i> opens by briefly and contemptuously setting aside more
philosophical opponents of Utilitarianism. The 'ascetic' principle,
for example, is the formal contradiction of the principle of Utility,
for it professedly declares pleasure to be evil. Could it be
consistently carried out it would turn earth into hell. But in fact it
is at bottom an illegitimate corollary from the very principle which
it ostensibly denies. It professes to condemn pleasure in general; it
really means that certain pleasures can only be bought at an excessive
cost of pain. Other theories are contrivances for avoiding the appeal
'to any external standard'; and in substance, therefore, they make the
opinion of the individual theorist an ultimate and sufficient reason.
Adam Smith by his doctrine of 'sympathy' makes the sentiment of
approval itself the ultimate standard. My feeling echoes yours, and
reciprocally; each cannot derive authority from the other. Another man
(Hutcheson) invents a thing made on purpose to tell him what is right
and what is wrong and calls it a 'moral sense.' Beattie substitutes
'common' for 'moral' sense, and his doctrine is attractive because
every man supposes himself to possess common sense. Others, like
Price, appeal to the Understanding, or, like Clarke, to the 'Fitness
of Things,' or they invent such phrases as 'Law of Nature,' or 'Right
Reason' or 'Natural Justice,' or what you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
please. Each really means
that whatever he says is infallibly true and self-evident. Wollaston
discovers that the only wrong thing is telling a lie; or that when you
kill your father, it is a way of saying that he is not your father,
and the same method is applicable to any conduct which he happens to
dislike. The 'fairest and openest of them all' is the man who says, 'I
am of the number of the Elect'; God tells the Elect what is right:
therefore if you want to know what is right, you have only to come to
me.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Bentham is writing here in his pithiest style. His criticism
is of course of the rough and ready order; but I think that in a
fashion he manages to hit the nail pretty well on the head.</p>

<p>His main point, at any rate, is clear. He argues briefly that the
alternative systems are illusory because they refer to no 'external
standard.' His opponents, not he, really make morality arbitrary.
This, whatever the ultimate truth, is in fact the essential core of
all the Utilitarian doctrine descended from or related to Benthamism.
Benthamism aims at converting morality into a science. Science,
according to him, must rest upon facts. It must apply to real things,
and to things which have definite relations and a common measure. Now,
if anything be real, pains and pleasures are real. The expectation of
pain or pleasure determines conduct; and, if so, it must be the sole
determinant of conduct. The attempt to conceal or evade this truth is
the fatal source of all equivocation and confusion. Try the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
experiment. Introduce a 'moral sense.' What is its relation to the
desire for happiness? If the dictates of the moral sense be treated as
ultimate, an absolutely arbitrary element is introduced; and we have
one of the 'innate ideas' exploded by Locke, a belief summarily
intruded into the system without definite relations to any other
beliefs: a dogmatic assertion which refuses to be tested or to be
correlated with other dogmas; a reduction therefore of the whole
system to chaos. It is at best an instinctive belief which requires to
be justified and corrected by reference to some other criterion. Or
resolve morality into 'reason,' that is, into some purely logical
truth, and it then remains in the air&mdash;a mere nonentity until
experience has supplied some material upon which it can work. Deny the
principle of utility, in short, as he says in a vigorous passage,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
and you are involved in a hopeless circle. Sooner or later you appeal
to an arbitrary and despotic principle and find that you have
substituted words for thoughts.</p>

<p>The only escape from this circle is the frank admission that happiness
is, in fact, the sole aim of man. There are, of course, different
kinds of happiness as there are different kinds of physical forces.
But the motives to action are, like the physical forces,
commensurable. Two courses of conduct can always be compared in
respect of the happiness produced, as two motions of a body can be
compared in respect of the energy expended. If, then, we take the
moral judgment to be simply a judgment of amounts of happiness, the
whole theory can be systematised, and its various theorems ranged
under a single axiom or consistent set of axioms. Pain and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> pleasure
give the real value of actions; they are the currency with a definite
standard into which every general rule may be translated. There is
always a common measure applicable in every formula for the estimation
of conduct. If you admit your Moral Sense, you profess to settle
values by some standard which has no definite relation to the standard
which in fact governs the normal transactions. But any such double
standard, in which the two measures are absolutely incommensurable,
leads straight to chaos. Or, if again you appeal to reason in the
abstract, you are attempting to settle an account by pure arithmetic
without reference to the units upon which your operation is performed.
Two pounds and two pounds will make four pounds whatever a pound may
be; but till I know what it is, the result is nugatory. Somewhere I
must come upon a basis of fact, if my whole construction is to stand.</p>

<p>This is the fundamental position implied in Bentham's doctrine. The
moral judgment is simply one case of the judgment of happiness.
Bentham is so much convinced of this that to him there appeared to be
in reality no other theory. What passed for theories were mere
combinations of words. Having said this, we know where to lay the
foundations of the new science. It deals with a vast complicity of
facts: it requires 'investigations as severe as mathematical ones, but
beyond all comparison more intricate and extensive.'<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Still it
deals with facts, and with facts which have a common measure, and can,
therefore, be presented as a coherent system. To present this system,
or so much of it as is required for purposes of legislation, is
therefore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
his next task. The partial execution is the chief substance
of the <i>Introduction</i>. Right and wrong conduct, we may now take for
granted, mean simply those classes of conduct which are conducive to
or opposed to happiness; or, in the sacred formula, to act rightly
means to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number. The
legislator, like every one else, acts rightly in so far as he is
guided by the principle (to use one of the phrases coined by Bentham)
of 'maximising' happiness. He seeks to affect conduct; and conduct can
be affected only by annexing pains or pleasures to given classes of
actions. Hence we have a vitally important part of his doctrine&mdash;the
theory of 'sanctions.' Pains and pleasures as annexed to action are
called 'sanctions.' There are 'physical or natural,' 'political,
'moral or popular,' and 'religious' sanctions. The 'physical'
sanctions are such pleasures and pains as follow a given course of
conduct independently of the interference of any other human or
supernatural being; the 'political' those which are annexed by the
action of the legislator; the 'moral or popular' those which are
annexed by other individuals not acting in a corporate capacity; and
the 'religious' those which are annexed by a 'superior invisible
being,' or, as he says elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> 'such as are capable of being
expected at the hands of an invisible Ruler of the Universe.' The
three last sanctions, he remarks, 'operate through the first.' The
'magistrate' or 'men at large' can only operate, and God is supposed
only to operate, 'through the powers of nature,' that is, by applying
some of the pains and pleasures which may also be natural sanctions. A
man is burnt: if by his own imprudence, that is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
'physical'
sanction; if by the magistrate, it is a 'political' sanction; if by
some neglect of his neighbours, due to their dislike of his 'moral
character,' a 'moral' sanction; if by the immediate act of God or by
distraction caused by dread of God's displeasure, it is a 'religious'
sanction. Of these, as Bentham characteristically observes<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> in a
later writing the political is much stronger than the 'moral' or
'religious.' Many men fear the loss of character or the 'wrath of
Heaven,' but all men fear the scourge and the gallows.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> He admits,
however, that the religious sanction and the additional sanction of
'benevolence' have the advantage of not requiring that the offender
should be found out.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> But in any case, the 'natural' and religious
sanctions are beyond the legislator's power. His problem, therefore,
is simply this: what sanctions ought he to annex to conduct, or
remembering that 'ought' means simply 'conducive to happiness,' what
political sanctions will increase happiness?</p>

<p>To answer this fully will be to give a complete system of legislation;
but in order to answer it we require a whole logical and psychological
apparatus. Bentham shows this apparatus at work, but does not expound
its origin in any separate treatise. Enough information, however, is
given as to his method in the curious collection of the fragments
connected with the <i>Chrestomathia</i>. A logical method upon which he
constantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
insisted is that of 'bipartition,'<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> called also the
'dichotomous' or 'bifurcate' method, and exemplified by the so-called
'Porphyrian Tree.' The principle is, of course, simple. Take any
genus: divide it into two classes, one of which has and the other has
not a certain mark. The two classes must be mutually exclusive and
together exhaustive. Repeat the operation upon each of the classes and
continue the process as long as desired.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> At every step you thus
have a complete enumeration of all the species, varieties, and so on,
each of which excludes all the others. No mere logic, indeed, can
secure the accuracy and still less the utility of the procedure. The
differences may be in themselves ambiguous or irrelevant. If I
classify plants as 'trees' and 'not trees,' the logical form is
satisfied: but I have still to ask whether 'tree' conveys a
determinate meaning, and whether the distinction corresponds to a
difference of any importance. A perfect classification, however, could
always be stated in this form. Each species, that is, can be marked by
the presence or absence of a given difference, whether we are dealing
with classes of plants or actions: and Bentham aims at that
consummation though he admits that centuries may be required for the
construction of an accurate classification in ethical
speculations.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> He exaggerates the efficiency of his method, and
overlooks the tendency of tacit assumptions to smuggle themselves into
what affects to be a mere enumeration of classes. But in any case, no
one could labour more industriously to get every object of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
thought arranged and labelled and put into the right pigeon-hole of
his mental museum. To codify<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> is to classify, and Bentham might be
defined as a codifying animal.</p>

<p>Things thus present themselves to Bentham's mind as already prepared
to fit into pigeon-holes. This is a characteristic point, and it
appears in what we must call his metaphysical system. 'Metaphysics,'
indeed, according to him, is simply 'a sprig,' and that a small one,
of the 'branch termed Logic.'<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> It is merely the explanation of
certain general terms such as 'existence,' 'necessity,' and so
forth.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Under this would apparently fall the explanation of
'reality' which leads to a doctrine upon which he often insists, and
which is most implicitly given in the fragment called <i>Ontology</i>. He
there distinguishes 'real' from 'fictitious entities,' a distinction
which, as he tells us,<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> he first learned from d'Alembert's phrase
<i>&Ecirc;tres fictifs</i> and which he applies in his <i>Morals and Legislation</i>.
'Real entities,' according to him,<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> are 'individual perceptions,'
'impressions,' and 'ideas.' In this, of course, he is following Hume,
though he applies the Johnsonian argument to Berkeley's
immaterialism.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> A 'fictitious entity' is a name which does note
'raise up in the mind any correspondent images.'<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Such names owe
their existence to the necessities of language. Without employing such
fictions, however, 'the language of man could not have risen above the
language of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
brutes';<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> and he emphatically distinguishes them from
'unreal' or 'fabulous entities.' A 'fictitious entity' is not a
'nonentity.'<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> He includes among such entities all Aristotle's
'predicaments' except the first: 'substance.'<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Quantity, quality,
relation, time, place are all 'physical fictitious entities.' This is
apparently equivalent to saying that the only 'physical entities' are
concrete things&mdash;sticks, stones, bodies, and so forth&mdash;the 'reality'
of which he takes for granted in the ordinary common sense meaning. It
is also perfectly true that things are really related, have quantity
and quality, and are in time and space. But we cannot really conceive
the quality or relation apart from the concrete things so qualified
and related. We are forced by language to use substantives which in
their nature have only the sense of adjectives. He does not suppose
that a body is not really square or round; but he thinks it a fiction
to speak of squareness or roundness or space in general as something
existing apart from matter and, in some sense, alongside of matter.</p>

<p>This doctrine, which brings us within sight of metaphysical problems
beyond our immediate purpose, becomes important to his moral
speculation. His special example of a 'fictitious entity' in politics
is 'obligation.'<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Obligations, rights, and similar words are
'fictitious entities.' Obligation in particular implies a metaphor.
The statement that a man is 'obliged' to perform an act means simply
that he will suffer pain if he does not perform it. The use of the
word obligation, as a noun substantive, introduces the 'fictitious
entity' which represents nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
really separable from the pain or
pleasure. Here, therefore, we have the ground of the doctrine already
noticed. 'Pains and pleasures' are real.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> 'Their existence,' he
says,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> 'is matter of universal and constant experience.' But other
various names referring to these: emotion, inclination, vice, virtue,
etc., are only 'psychological entities.' 'Take away pleasures and
pains, not only happiness but justice and duty and obligation and
virtue&mdash;all of which have been so elaborately held up to view as
independent of them&mdash;are so many empty sounds.'<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> The ultimate
facts, then, are pains and pleasures. They are the substantives of
which these other words are properly the adjectives. A pain or a
pleasure may exist by itself, that is without being virtuous or
vicious: but virtue and vice can only exist in so far as pain and
pleasure exists.</p>

<p>This analysis of 'obligation' is a characteristic doctrine of the
Utilitarian school. We are under an 'obligation' so far as we are
affected by a 'sanction.' It appeared to Bentham so obvious as to need
no demonstration, only an exposition of the emptiness of any verbal
contradiction. Such metaphysical basis as he needed is simply the
attempt to express the corresponding conception of reality which, in
his opinion, only requires to be expressed to carry conviction.</p>

<p class="scs">II. <a name="VI_II" id="VI_II"></a>SPRINGS OF ACTION</p>

<p>Our path is now clear. Pains and pleasures give us what mathematicians
call the 'independent variable.'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Our units are (in Bentham's phrase)
'lots' of pain or pleasure. We have to interpret all the facts in
terms of pain or pleasure, and we shall have the materials for what
has since been called a 'felicific calculus.' To construct this with a
view to legislation is his immediate purpose. The theory will fall
into two parts: the 'pathological,' or an account of all the pains and
pleasures which are the primary data; and the 'dynamical,' or an
account of the various modes of conduct determined by expectations of
pain and pleasure. This gives the theory of 'springs of action,'
considered in themselves, and of 'motives,' that is, of the springs as
influencing conduct.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> The 'pathology' contains, in the first
place, a discussion of the measure of pain and pleasure in general;
secondly, a discussion of the various species of pain and pleasure;
and thirdly, a discussion of the varying sensibilities of different
individuals to pain and pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Thus under the first head, we
are told that the value of a pleasure, considered by itself, depends
upon its intensity, duration, certainty, and propinquity; and,
considered with regard to modes of obtaining it, upon its fecundity
(or tendency to produce other pains and pleasures) and its purity (or
freedom from admixture of other pains and pleasures). The pain or
pleasure is thus regarded as an entity which is capable of being in
some sense weighed and measured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>
The next step is to classify
pains and pleasures, which though commensurable as psychological
forces, have obviously very different qualities. Bentham gives the
result of his classification without the analysis upon which it
depends. He assures us that he has obtained an 'exhaustive' list of
'simple pleasures.' It must be confessed that the list does not
commend itself either as exhaustive or as composed of 'simple
pleasures.' He does not explain the principle of his analysis because
he says, it was of 'too metaphysical a cast,'<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> but he thought it
so important that he published it, edited with considerable
modifications by James Mill, in 1817, as a <i>Table of the Springs of
Action</i>.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>J. S. Mill remarks that this table should be studied by any one who
would understand Bentham's philosophy. Such a study would suggest some
unfavourable conclusions. Bentham seems to have made out his table
without the slightest reference to any previous psychologist.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
It is
simply constructed to meet the requirements of his legislative
theories. As psychology it would be clearly absurd, especially if
taken as giving the elementary or 'simple' feelings. No one can
suppose, for example, that the pleasures of 'wealth' or 'power' are
'simple' pleasures. The classes therefore are not really distinct, and
they are as far from being exhaustive. All that can be said for the
list is that it gives a sufficiently long enumeration to call
attention from his own point of view to most of the ordinary pleasures
and pains; and contains as much psychology as he could really turn to
account for his purpose.</p>

<p>The omissions with which his greatest disciple charges him are
certainly significant. We find, says Mill, no reference to
'Conscience,' 'Principle,' 'Moral Rectitude,' or 'Moral Duty' among
the 'springs of action,' unless among the synonyms of a 'love of
reputation,' or in so far as 'Conscience' and 'Principle' are
sometimes synonymous with the 'religious' motive or the motive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> of
'sympathy.' So the sense of 'honour,' the love of beauty, and of
order, of power (except in the narrow sense of power over our fellows)
and of action in general are all omitted. We may conjecture what reply
Bentham would have made to this criticism. The omission of the love of
beauty and &aelig;sthetic pleasures may surprise us when we remember that
Bentham loved music, if he cared nothing for poetry. But he apparently
regarded these as 'complex pleasures,'<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> and therefore not
admissible into his table, if it be understood as an analysis into the
simple pleasures alone. The pleasures of action are deliberately
omitted, for Bentham pointedly gives the 'pains' of labour as a class
without corresponding pleasure; and this, though indicative, I think,
of a very serious error, is characteristic rather of his method of
analysis than of his real estimate of pleasure. Nobody could have
found more pleasure than Bentham in intellectual labour, but he
separated the pleasure from the labour. He therefore thought 'labour,'
as such, a pure evil, and classified the pleasure as a pleasure of
'curiosity.' But the main criticism is more remarkable. Mill certainly
held himself to be a sound Utilitarian; and yet he seems to be
condemning Bentham for consistent Utilitarianism. Bentham, by
admitting the 'conscience' into his simple springs of action, would
have fallen into the very circle from which he was struggling to
emerge. If, in fact, the pleasures of conscience are simple pleasures,
we have the objectionable 'moral sense' intruded as an ultimate factor
of human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
nature. To get rid of that 'fictitious entity' is precisely
Bentham's aim. The moral judgment is to be precisely equivalent to the
judgment: 'this or that kind of conduct increases or diminishes the
sum of human pains or pleasures.' Once allow that among the pains and
pleasures themselves is an ultimate conscience&mdash;a faculty not
constructed out of independent pains and pleasures&mdash;and the system
becomes a vicious circle. Conscience on any really Utilitarian scheme
must be a derivative, not an ultimate, faculty. If, as Mill seems to
say, the omission is a blunder, Bentham's Utilitarianism at least must
be an erroneous system.</p>

<p>We have now our list both of pains and pleasures and of the general
modes of variation by which their value is to be measured. We must
also allow for the varying sensibilities of different persons. Bentham
accordingly gives a list of thirty-two 'circumstances influencing
sensibility.'<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Human beings differ in constitution, character,
education, sex, race, and so forth, and in their degrees of
sensibility to all the various classes of pains and pleasures; the
consideration of these varieties is of the highest utility for the
purposes of the judge and the legislator.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The 'sanctions' will
operate differently in different cases. A blow will have different
effects upon the sick and upon the healthy; the same fine imposed upon
the rich and the poor will cause very different pains; and a law which
is beneficent in Europe may be a scourge in America.</p>

<p>We have thus our 'pathology' or theory of the passive sensibilities of
man. We know what are the 'springs of action,' how they vary in
general, and how they vary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
from one man to another. We can therefore
pass to the dynamics.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> We have described the machinery in rest,
and can now consider it in motion. We proceed as before by first
considering action in general: which leads to consideration of the
'intention' and the 'motive' implied by any conscious action: and
hence of the relation of these to the 'springs of action' as already
described. The discussion is minute and elaborate; and Bentham
improves as he comes nearer to the actual problems of legislation and
further from the ostensible bases of psychology. The analysis of
conduct, and of the sanctions by which conduct is modified, involves a
view of morals and of the relations between the spheres of morality
and legislation which is of critical importance for the whole
Utilitarian creed. 'Moral laws' and a 'Positive law' both affect human
action. How do they differ? Bentham's treatment of the problem shows,
I think, a clearer appreciation of some difficulties than might be
inferred from his later utterances. In any case, it brings into clear
relief a moral doctrine which deeply affected his successors.</p>

give the following conjectural account of the list as it appears in
the <i>Morals and Legislation</i> above. In classifying pain or pleasures,
Bentham is, I think, following the clue suggested by his 'sanctions.'
He is really classifying according to their causes or the way in which
they are 'annexed.' Thus pleasures may or may not be dependent upon
other persons, or if upon other persons, may be indirectly or directly
caused by their pleasures or pains. Pleasures not caused by persons
correspond to the 'physical sanction,' and are those (1) of the
'senses,' (2) of wealth, <i>i.e.</i> caused by the possession of things,
and (3) of 'skill,' <i>i.e.</i> caused by our ability to use things.
Pleasures caused by persons indirectly correspond first to the
'popular or moral sanction,' and are pleasures (4) of 'amity,' caused
by the goodwill of individuals, and (5) of a 'good name,' caused by
the goodwill of people in general; secondly, to 'political sanction,'
namely (6) pleasures of 'power'; and thirdly, to the 'religious
sanction,' or (7) pleasures of 'piety.' All these are 'self-regarding
pleasures.' The pleasures caused directly by the pleasure of others
are those (8) of 'benevolence,' and (9) of malevolence. We then have
what is really a cross division by classes of 'derivative' pleasures;
these being due to (10) memory, (11) imagination, (12) expectation,
(13) association. To each class of pleasures corresponds a class of
pains, except that there are no pains corresponding to the pleasures
of wealth or power. We have, however, a general class of pains of
'privation,' which might include pains of poverty or weakness: and to
these are opposed (14) pleasures of 'relief,' <i>i.e.</i> of the privation
of pains. In the <i>Table</i>, as separately published, Bentham modified
this by dividing pleasures of sense into three classes, the last of
which includes the two first; by substituting pleasures of 'curiosity'
for pleasures of 'skill' by suppressing pleasures of relief and pains
of privation; and by adding, as a class of 'pains' without
corresponding pleasures, pains (1) of labour, (2) of 'death, and
bodily pains in general.' These changes seem to have been introduced
in the course of writing his <i>Introduction</i>, where they are partly
assumed. Another class is added to include all classes of
'self-regarding pleasures or pains.' He is trying to give a list of
all 'synonyms' for various pains and pleasures, and has therefore to
admit classes corresponding to general names which include other
classes.</p></div>

<p class="scs">III. <a name="VI_III" id="VI_III"></a>THE SANCTIONS</p>

<p>Let us first take his definitions of the fundamental conceptions. All
action of reasonable beings implies the expectation of consequences.
The agent's 'intention' is defined by the consequences actually
contemplated. The cause of action is the hope of the consequent
pleasures or the dread of the consequent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
pains. This anticipated
pleasure or pain constitutes the 'internal motive' (a phrase used by
Bentham to exclude the 'external motive' or event which causes the
anticipation).<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> The motive, or 'internal motive,' is the
anticipation of pain to be avoided or pleasure to be gained. Actions
are good or bad simply and solely as they are on the whole 'productive
of a balance of pleasure or pain.' The problem of the legislator is
how to regulate actions so as to incline the balance to the right
side. His weapons are 'sanctions' which modify 'motives.' What
motives, then, should be strengthened or checked? Here we must be
guided by a principle which is, in fact, the logical result of the
doctrines already laid down. We are bound to apply our 'felicific
calculus' with absolute impartiality. We must therefore assign equal
value to all motives. 'No motives,' he says,<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> are 'constantly good
or constantly bad.' Pleasure is itself a good; pain itself an evil:
nay, they are 'the only good and the only evil.' This is true of every
sort of pain and pleasure, even of the pains and pleasures of illwill.
The pleasures of 'malevolence' are placed in his 'table' by the side
of pleasures of 'benevolence.' Hence it 'follows immediately and
incontestably, that there is no such thing as any sort of motive that
is in itself a bad one.' The doctrine is no doubt a logical deduction
from Bentham's assumptions, and he proceeds to illustrate its meaning.
A 'motive' corresponds to one of his 'springs of action.' He shows how
every one of the motives included in his table may lead either to good
or to bad consequences. The desire of wealth may lead me to kill a
man's enemy or to plough his field for him; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
fear of God may
prompt to fanaticism or to charity; illwill may lead to malicious
conduct or may take the form of proper 'resentment,' as, for example,
when I secure the punishment of my father's murderer. Though one act,
he says, is approved and the other condemned, they spring from the
same motive, namely, illwill.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> He admits, however, that some
motives are more likely than others to lead to 'useful' conduct; and
thus arranges them in a certain 'order of pre-eminence.'<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> It is
obvious that 'goodwill,' 'love of reputation,' and the 'desire of
amity' are more likely than others to promote general happiness. 'The
dictates of utility,' as he observes, are simply the 'dictates of the
most extensive and enlightened (that is, <i>well advised</i>) benevolence.'
It would, therefore, seem more appropriate to call the 'motive' good;
though no one doubts that when directed by an erroneous judgment it
may incidentally be mischievous.</p>

<p>The doctrine that morality depends upon 'consequences' and not upon
'motives' became a characteristic Utilitarian dogma, and I shall have
to return to the question. Meanwhile, it was both a natural and, I
think, in some senses, a correct view, when strictly confined to the
province of legislation. For reasons too obvious to expand, the
legislator must often be indifferent to the question of motives. He
cannot know with certainty what are a man's motives. He must enforce
the law whatever may be the motives for breaking it; and punish
rebellion, for example, even if he attributes it to misguided
philanthropy. He can, in any case, punish only such crimes as are
found out; and must define crimes by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
palpable 'external' marks. He
must punish by such coarse means as the gallows and the gaol: for his
threats must appeal to the good and the bad alike. He depends,
therefore, upon 'external' sanctions, sanctions, that is, which work
mainly upon the fears of physical pain; and even if his punishments
affect the wicked alone, they clearly cannot reach the wicked as
wicked, nor in proportion to their wickedness. That is quite enough to
show why in positive law motives are noticed indirectly or not at all.
It shows also that the analogy between the positive and the moral law
is treacherous. The exclusion of motive justifiable in law may take
all meaning out of morality. The Utilitarians, as we shall see, were
too much disposed to overlook the difference, and attempt to apply
purely legal doctrine in the totally uncongenial sphere of ethical
speculation. To accept the legal classification of actions by their
external characteristics is, in fact, to beg the question in advance.
Any outward criterion must group together actions springing from
different 'motives' and therefore, as other moralists would say,
ethically different.</p>

<p>There is, however, another meaning in this doctrine which is more to
the purpose here. Bentham was aiming at a principle which, true or
false, is implied in all ethical systems based upon experience instead
of pure logic or <i>a priori</i> 'intuitions.' Such systems must accept
human nature as a fact, and as the basis of a scientific theory. They
do not aim at creating angels but at developing the existing
constitution of mankind. So far as an action springs from one of the
primitive or essential instincts of mankind, it simply proves the
agent to be human, not to be vicious or virtuous, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
therefore is no
ground for any moral judgment. If Bentham's analysis could be
accepted, this would be true of his 'springs of action.' The natural
appetites have not in themselves a moral quality: they are simply
necessary and original data in the problem. The perplexity is
introduced by Bentham's assumption that conduct can be analysed so
that the 'motive' is a separate entity which can be regarded as the
sole cause of a corresponding action. That involves an irrelevant
abstraction. There is no such thing as a single 'motive.' One of his
cases is a mother who lets her child die for love of 'ease.' We do not
condemn her because she loves ease, which is a motive common to all
men and therefore unmoral, not immoral. But neither do we condemn her
merely for the bad consequences of a particular action. We condemn her
because she loves ease better than she loves her child: that is,
because her whole character is 'unnatural' or ill-balanced, not on
account of a particular element taken by itself. Morality is concerned
with concrete human beings, and not with 'motives' running about by
themselves. Bentham's meaning, if we make the necessary correction,
would thus be expressed by saying that we don't blame a man because he
has the 'natural' passions, but because they are somehow wrongly
proportioned or the man himself wrongly constituted. Passions which
may make a man vicious may also be essential to the highest virtue.
That is quite true; but the passion is not a separate agent, only one
constituent of the character.</p>

<p>Bentham admits this in his own fashion. If 'motives' cannot be
properly called good or bad, is there, he asks, nothing good or bad in
the man who on a given occasion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
obeys a certain motive? 'Yes,
certainly,' he replies, 'his disposition.'<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The disposition, he
adds, is a 'fictitious entity, and designed for the convenience of
discourse in order to express what there is supposed to be permanent
in a man's frame of mind.' By 'fictitious,' as we have seen, he means
not 'unreal' but simply not tangible, weighable, or measurable&mdash;like
sticks and stones, or like pains and pleasures. 'Fictitious' as they
may be, therefore, the fiction enables us to express real truths, and
to state facts which are of the highest importance to the moralist and
the legislator. Bentham discusses some cases of casuistry in order to
show the relation between the tendency of an action and the intention
and motives of the agent. Ravaillac murders a good king; Ravaillac's
son enables his father to escape punishment, or conveys poison to his
father to enable him to avoid torture by suicide.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> What is the
inference as to the son's disposition in either case? The solution (as
he substantially and, I think, rightly suggests) will have to be
reached by considering whether the facts indicate that the son's
disposition was mischievous or otherwise; whether it indicates
political disloyalty or filial affection, and so forth, and in what
proportions. The most interesting case perhaps is that of religious
persecution, where the religious motive is taken to be good, and the
action to which it leads is yet admitted to be mischievous. The
problem is often puzzling, but we are virtually making an inference as
to the goodness or badness of the 'disposition' implied by the given
action under all the supposed circumstances. This gives what Bentham
calls the 'meritoriousness'<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> of the disposition. The 'intention'
is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
caused by the 'motive.' The 'disposition' is the 'sum of the
intentions'; that is to say, it expresses the agent's sensibility to
various classes of motives; and the merit therefore will be in
proportion to the total goodness or badness of the disposition thus
indicated. The question of merit leads to interesting moral problems.
Bentham, however, observes that he is not here speaking from the point
of view of the moralist but of the legislator. Still, as a legislator
he has to consider what is the 'depravity' of disposition indicated by
different kinds of conduct. This consideration is of great importance.
The 'disposition' includes sensibility to what he calls 'tutelary
motives'&mdash;motives, that is, which deter a man from such conduct as
generally produces mischievous consequences. No motive can be
invariably, though some, especially the motive of goodwill, and in a
minor degree those of 'amity' and a 'love of reputation,' are
generally, on the right side. The legislator has to reinforce these
'tutelary motives' by 'artificial tutelary motives,' and mainly by
appealing to the 'love of ease,' that is, by making mischievous
conduct more difficult, and to 'self-preservation,' that is, by making
it more dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> He has therefore to measure the force by which
these motives will be opposed; or, in other words, the 'strength of
the temptation.' Now the more depraved a man's disposition, the weaker
the temptation which will seduce him to crime. Consequently if an act
shows depravity, it will require a stronger counter-motive or a more
severe punishment, as the disposition indicated is more mischievous.
An act, for example, which implies deliberation proves a greater
insensibility to these social
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
motives which, as Bentham remarks,<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
determine the 'general tenor of a man's life,' however depraved he may
be. The legislator is guided solely by 'utility,' or aims at
maximising happiness without reference to its quality. Still, so far
as action implies disposition, he has to consider the depravity as a
source of mischief. The legislator who looks solely at the moral
quality implied is wrong; and, if guided solely by his sympathies, has
no measure for the amount of punishment to be inflicted. These
considerations will enable us to see what is the proper measure of
resentment.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>The doctrine of the neutrality or 'unmorality' of motive is thus
sufficiently clear. Bentham's whole aim is to urge that the criterion
of morality is given by the consequences of actions. To say the
conduct is good or bad is to say in other words that it produces a
balance of pleasure or pain. To make the criterion independent, or
escape the vicious circle, we must admit the pleasures and pains to be
in themselves neutral; to have, that is, the same value, if equally
strong, whatever their source. In our final balance-sheet we must set
down pains of illwill and of goodwill, of sense and of intellect with
absolute impartiality, and compare them simply in respect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> of
intensity. We must not admit a 'conscience' or 'moral sense' which
would be autocratic; nor, indeed, allow moral to have any meaning as
applied to the separate passions. But it is quite consistent with this
to admit that some motives, goodwill in particular, generally tend to
bring out the desirable result, that is, a balance of pleasure for the
greatest number. The pains and pleasures are the ultimate facts, and
the 'disposition' is a 'fictitious entity' or a name for the sum of
sensibilities. It represents the fact that some men are more inclined
than others to increase the total of good or bad.</p>

rise with the strength of the temptation, a theory which leads to some
curious casuistical problems. He does not fully discuss, and I cannot
here consider, them. I will only note that it may conceivably be
necessary to increase the severity of punishment, instead of removing
the temptation or strengthening the preventive action. If so, the law
becomes immoral in the sense of punishing more severely as the crime
has more moral excuse. This was often true of the old criminal law,
which punished offences cruelly because it had no effective system of
police. Bentham would of course have agreed that the principle in this
case was a bad one.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="scs">IV. <a name="VI_IV" id="VI_IV"></a>CRIMINAL LAW</p>

<p>We have now, after a long analysis, reached the point at which the
principles can be applied to penal law. The legislator has to
discourage certain classes of conduct by annexing 'tutelary motives.'
The classes to be suppressed are of course those which diminish
happiness. Pursuing the same method, and applying results already
reached, we must in the first place consider how the 'mischief of an
act' is to be measured.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Acts are mischievous as their
'consequences' are mischievous; and the consequences may be 'primary'
or 'secondary.' Robbery causes pain to the loser of the money. That is
a primary evil. It alarms the holders of money; it suggests the
facility of robbery to others; and it weakens the 'tutelary motive' of
respect for property. These are secondary evils. The 'secondary' evil
may be at times the most important. The non-payment of a tax may do
no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
appreciable harm in a particular case. But its secondary effects
in injuring the whole political fabric may be disastrous and fruitful
beyond calculation. Bentham proceeds to show carefully how the
'intentions' and 'motives' of the evildoer are of the greatest
importance, especially in determining these secondary consequences,
and must therefore be taken into account by the legislator. A homicide
may cause the same primary evil, whether accidental or malignant; but
accidental homicide may cause no alarm, whereas the intentional and
malignant homicide may cause any quantity of alarm and shock to the
general sense of security. In this way, therefore, the legislator has
again indirectly to take into account the moral quality which is
itself dependent upon utility.</p>

<p>I must, however, pass lightly over a very clear and interesting
discussion to reach a further point of primary importance to the
Utilitarian theory, as to the distinction between the moral and legal
spheres.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Bentham has now 'made an analysis of evil.' He has, that
is, classified the mischiefs produced by conduct, measured simply by
their effect upon pleasures or pains, independently of any
consideration as to virtue and vice. The next problem is: what conduct
should be criminal?&mdash;a subject which is virtually discussed in two
chapters (xv. and xix.) 'on cases unmeet for punishment' and on 'the
limits between Private Ethics and the act of legislation.' We must, of
course, follow the one clue to the labyrinth. We must count all the
'lots' of pain and pleasure indifferently. It is clear, on the one
hand, that the pains suffered by criminals are far less than the pains
which would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
suffered were no such sanctions applied. On the other
hand, all punishment is an evil, because punishment means pain, and it
is therefore only to be inflicted when it excludes greater pain. It
must, therefore, not be inflicted when it is 'groundless,'
'inefficacious,' 'unprofitable,' or 'needless.' 'Needless' includes
all the cases in which the end may be attained 'as effectually at a
cheaper rate.'<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> This applies to all 'dissemination of pernicious
principles'; for in this case reason and not force is the appropriate
remedy. The sword inflicts more pain, and is less efficient than the
pen. The argument raises the wider question, What are the true limits
of legislative interference? Bentham, in his last chapter, endeavours
to answer this problem. 'Private ethics,' he says, and 'legislation'
aim at the same end, namely, happiness, and the 'acts with which they
are conversant are <i>in great measure</i> the same.' Why, then, should
they have different spheres? Simply because the acts 'are not
<i>perfectly and throughout</i> the same.'<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> How, then, are we to draw
the line? By following the invariable clue of 'utility.' We simply
have to apply an analysis to determine the cases in which punishment
does more harm than good. He insists especially upon the cases in
which punishment is 'unprofitable'; upon such offences as drunkenness
and sexual immorality, where the law could only be enforced by a
mischievous or impossible system of minute supervision, and such
offences as ingratitude or rudeness, where the definition is so vague
that the judge could not safely be entrusted with the power to
punish.'<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> He endeavours to give a rather more precise distinction
by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
subdividing 'ethics in general' into three classes. Duty may be to
oneself, that is 'prudence'; or to one's neighbour negatively, that is
'probity'; or to one's neighbour positively, that is
'benevolence.'<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Duties of the first class must be left chiefly to
the individual, because he is the best judge of his own interest.
Duties of the third class again are generally too vague to be enforced
by the legislator, though a man ought perhaps to be punished for
failing to help as well as for actually injuring. The second
department of ethics, that of 'probity,' is the main field for
legislative activity.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> As a general principle, 'private ethics'
teach a man how to pursue his own happiness, and the art of
legislation how to pursue the greatest happiness of the community. It
must be noticed, for the point is one of importance, that Bentham's
purely empirical method draws no definite line. It implies that no
definite line can be drawn. It does not suggest that any kind of
conduct whatever is outside the proper province of legislator except
in so far as the legislative machinery may happen to be inadequate or
inappropriate.</p>

<p>Our analysis has now been carried so far that we can proceed to
consider the principles by which we should be guided in punishing.
What are the desirable properties of a 'lot of punishment'? This
occupies two interesting chapters. Chapter xvi., 'on the proportion
between punishments and offences,' gives twelve rules. The punishment,
he urges, must outweigh the profit of the offence; it must be such as
to make a man prefer a less offence to a greater&mdash;simple theft, for
example, to violent robbery; it must be such that the punishment must
be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
adaptable to the varying sensibility of the offender; it must be
greater in 'value' as it falls short of certainty; and, when the
offence indicates a habit, it must outweigh not only the profit of the
particular offence, but of the undetected offences. In chapter xvii.
Bentham considers the properties which fit a punishment to fulfil
these conditions. Eleven properties are given. The punishment must be
(1) 'variable,' that is, capable of adjustment to particular cases;
and (2) equable, or inflicting equal pain by equal sentences. Thus the
'proportion' between punishment and crimes of a given class can be
secured. In order that the punishments of different classes of crime
may be proportional, the punishments should (3) be commensurable. To
make punishments efficacious they should be (4) 'characteristical' or
impressive to the imagination; and that they may not be excessive they
should be (5) exemplary or likely to impress others, and (6) frugal.
To secure minor ends they should be (7) reformatory; (8) disabling,
<i>i.e.</i> from future offences; and (9) compensatory to the sufferer.
Finally, to avoid collateral disadvantages they should be (10)
popular, and (11) remittable. A twelfth property, simplicity, was
added in Dumont's redaction. Dumont calls attention here to the value
of Bentham's method.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Montesquieu and Beccaria had spoken in
general terms of the desirable qualities of punishment. They had
spoken of 'proportionality,' for example, but without that precise or
definite meaning which appears in Bentham's Calculus. In fact,
Bentham's statement, compared to the vaguer utterances of his
predecessors, but still more when compared to the haphazard
brutalities and inconsistencies of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
English criminal law, gives the
best impression of the value of his method.</p>

<p>Bentham's next step is an elaborate classification of offences, worked
out by a further application of his bifurcatory method.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> This
would form the groundwork of the projected code. I cannot, however,
speak of this classification, or of many interesting remarks contained
in the <i>Principles of Penal Law</i>, where some further details are
considered. An analysis scarcely does justice to Bentham, for it has
to omit his illustrations and his flashes of real vivacity. The mere
dry logical framework is not appetising. I have gone so far in order
to illustrate the characteristic of Bentham's teaching. It was not the
bare appeal to utility, but the attempt to follow the clue of utility
systematically and unflinchingly into every part of the subject. This
one doctrine gives the touchstone by which every proposed measure is
to be tested; and which will give to his system not such unity as
arises from the development of an abstract logical principle, but such
as is introduced into the physical sciences when we are able to range
all the indefinitely complex phenomena which arise under some simple
law of force. If Bentham's aim could have been achieved, 'utility'
would have been in legislative theories what gravitation is in
astronomical theories. All human conduct being ruled by pain and
pleasure, we could compare all motives and actions, and trace out the
consequences of any given law. I shall have hereafter to consider how
this conception worked in different minds and was applied to different
problems: what were the tenable results to which it led, and what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
were the errors caused by the implied oversight of some essential
considerations.</p>

<p>Certain weaknesses are almost too obvious to be specified. He claimed
to be constructing a science, comparable to the physical sciences. The
attempt was obviously chimerical if we are to take it seriously. The
makeshift doctrine which he substitutes for psychology would be a
sufficient proof of the incapacity for his task. He had probably not
read such writers as Hartley or Condillac, who might have suggested
some ostensibly systematic theory. If he had little psychology he had
not even a conception of 'sociology.' The 'felicific calculus' is
enough to show the inadequacy of his method. The purpose is to enable
us to calculate the effects of a proposed law. You propose to send
robbers to the gallows or the gaol. You must, says Bentham, reckon up
all the evils prevented: the suffering to the robbed, and to those who
expect to be robbed, on the one hand; and, on the other, the evils
caused, the suffering to the robber, and to the tax-payer who keeps
the constable; then strike your balance and make your law if the evils
prevented exceed the evils caused. Some such calculation is demanded
by plain common sense. It points to the line of inquiry desirable. But
can it be adequate? To estimate the utility of a law we must take into
account all its 'effects.' What are the 'effects' of a law against
robbery? They are all that is implied in the security of property.
They correspond to the difference between England in the eighteenth
century and England in the time of Hengist and Horsa; between a
country where the supremacy of law is established, and a country still
under the rule of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
strong hand. Bentham's method may be applicable
at a given moment, when the social structure is already consolidated
and uniform. It would represent the practical arguments for
establishing the police-force demanded by Colquhoun, and show the
disadvantages of the old constables and watchmen. Bentham, that is,
gives an admirable method for settling details of administrative and
legislative machinery, and dealing with particular cases when once the
main principles of law and order are established. Those principles,
too, may depend upon 'utility,' but utility must be taken in a wider
sense when we have to deal with the fundamental questions. We must
consider the 'utility' of the whole organisation, not the fitness of
separate details. Finally, if Bentham is weak in psychology and in
sociology, he is clearly not satisfactory in ethics. Morality is,
according to him, on the same plane with law. The difference is not in
the sphere to which they apply, or in the end to which they are
directed; but solely in the 'sanction.' The legislator uses threats of
physical suffering; the moralist threats of 'popular' disapproval.
Either 'sanction' may be most applicable to a given case; but the
question is merely between different means to the same end under
varying conditions. This implies the 'external' character of Bentham's
morality, and explains his insistence upon the neutrality of motives.
He takes the average man to be a compound of certain instincts, and
merely seeks to regulate their action by supplying 'artificial
tutelary motives.' The 'man' is given; the play of his instincts,
separately neutral, makes his conduct more or less favourable to
general happiness; and the moralist and the legislator have both to
correct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
his deviations by supplying appropriate 'sanctions.' Bentham,
therefore, is inclined to ignore the intrinsic character of morality,
or the dependence of a man's morality upon the essential structure of
his nature. He thinks of the superficial play of forces, not of their
intimate constitution. The man is not to be changed in either case;
only his circumstances. Such defects no doubt diminish the value of
Bentham's work. Yet, after all, in his own sphere they are trifles. He
did very well without philosophy. However imperfect his system might
be considered as a science or an ultimate explanation of society and
human nature, it was very much to the point as an expression of
downright common sense. Dumont's eulogy seems to be fully deserved,
when we contrast Bentham's theory of punishment with the theories (if
they deserve the name) of contemporary legislators. His method
involved a thoroughgoing examination of the whole body of laws, and a
resolution to apply a searching test to every law. If that test was
not so unequivocal or ultimate as he fancied, it yet implied the
constant application of such considerations as must always carry
weight, and, perhaps, be always the dominant considerations, with the
actual legislator or jurist. What is the use of you? is a question
which may fairly be put to every institution and to every law; and it
concerns legislators to find some answer, even though the meaning of
the word 'use' is not so clear as we could wish.</p>

<p>The practical value of Bentham's method is perhaps best illustrated by
his <i>Rationale of Evidence</i>. The composition of the papers ultimately
put together by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
J. S. Mill had occupied Bentham from 1802 to 1812.
The changed style is significant. Nobody could write more pointedly,
or with happier illustrations, than Bentham in his earlier years. He
afterwards came to think that a didactic treatise should sacrifice
every other virtue to fulness and precision. To make a sentence
precise, every qualifying clause must be somehow forced into the
original formula. Still more characteristic is his application of what
he calls the 'substantive-preferring principle.'<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> He would rather
say, 'I give extension to an object,' than 'I extend an object.' Where
a substantive is employed, the idea is 'stationed upon a rock'; if
only a verb, the idea is 'like a leaf floating on a stream.' A verb,
he said,<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> 'slips through your fingers like an eel.' The principle
corresponds to his 'metaphysics.' The universe of thought is made up
of a number of separate 'entities' corresponding to nouns-substantive,
and when these bundles are distinctly isolated by appropriate nouns,
the process of arranging and codifying according to the simple
relations indicated by the copula is greatly facilitated. The ideal
language would resemble algebra, in which symbols, each representing a
given numerical value, are connected by the smallest possible number
of symbols of operation, +, -, =, and so forth. To set two such
statements side by side, or to modify them by inserting different
constants, is then a comparatively easy process, capable of being
regulated by simple general rules. Bentham's style becomes tiresome,
and was often improperly called obscure. It requires attention, but
the meaning is never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
doubtful&mdash;and to the end we have frequent
flashes of the old vivacity.</p>

<p>The <i>Rationale of Evidence</i>, as Mill remarks,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> is 'one of the
richest in matter of all Bentham's productions.' It contains, too,
many passages in Bentham's earlier style, judiciously preserved by his
young editor; indeed, so many that I am tempted even to call the book
amusing. In spite of the wearisome effort to say everything, and to
force language into the mould presented by his theory, Bentham
attracts us by his obvious sincerity. The arguments may be
unsatisfactory, but they are genuine arguments. They represent
conviction; they are given because they have convinced; and no reader
can deny that they really tend to convince. We may complain that there
are too many words, and that the sentences are cumbrous; but the
substance is always to the point. The main purpose may be very briefly
indicated. Bentham begins by general considerations upon evidence, in
which he and his youthful editor indicate their general adherence to
the doctrines of Hume.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> This leads to an application of the
methods expounded in the 'Introduction,' in order to show how the
various motives or 'springs of action' and the 'sanctions' based upon
them may affect the trustworthiness of evidence. Any motive whatever
may incidentally cause 'mendacity.' The second book, therefore,
considers what securities may be taken for 'securing trustworthiness.'
We have, for example, a discussion of the value of oaths (he thinks
them valueless), of the advantages and disadvantages of reducing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
evidence to writing, of interrogating witnesses, and of the publicity
or privacy of evidence. Book iii. deals with the 'extraction of
evidence.' We have to compare the relative advantages of oral and
written evidence, the rules for cross-examining witnesses and for
taking evidence as to their character. Book iv. deals with
'pre-appointed evidence,' the cases, that is, in which events are
recorded at the time of occurrence with a view to their subsequent use
as evidence. We have under this head to consider the formalities which
should be required in regard to contracts and wills; and the mode of
recording judicial and other official decisions and registering
births, deaths, and marriages. In Books v. and vi. we consider two
kinds of evidence which is in one way or other of inferior cogency,
namely, 'circumstantial evidence,' in which the evidence if accepted
still leaves room for a process of more or less doubtful inference;
and 'makeshift evidence,' such evidence as must sometimes be accepted
for want of the best, of which the most conspicuous instance is
'hearsay evidence.' Book vii. deals with the 'authentication' of
evidence. Book viii. is a consideration of the 'technical' system,
that namely which was accepted by English lawyers; and finally Book
ix. deals with a special point, namely, the exclusion of evidence.
Bentham announces at starting<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> that he shall establish 'one
theorem' and consider two problems. The problems are: 'what securities
can be taken for the truth of evidence?' and 'what rules can be given
for estimating the value of evidence?' The 'theorem' is that no
evidence should be excluded with the professed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
intention of obtaining
a right decision; though some must be excluded to avoid expense,
vexation, and delay. This, therefore, as his most distinct moral, is
fully treated in the last book.</p>

<p>Had Bentham confined himself to a pithy statement of his leading
doctrines, and confirmed them by a few typical cases, he would have
been more effective in a literary sense. His passion for
'codification,' for tabulating and arranging facts in all their
complexity, and for applying his doctrine at full length to every case
that he can imagine, makes him terribly prolix. On the other hand,
this process no doubt strengthened his own conviction and the
conviction of his disciples as to the value of his process. Follow
this clue of utility throughout the whole labyrinth, see what a clear
answer it offers at every point, and you cannot doubt that you are in
possession of the true compass for such a navigation. Indeed, it seems
to be indisputable that Bentham's arguments are the really relevant
and important arguments. How can we decide any of the points which
come up for discussion? Should a witness be cross-examined? Should his
evidence be recorded? Should a wife be allowed to give evidence
against her husband? or the defendant to give evidence about his own
case? These and innumerable other points can only be decided by
reference to what Bentham understood by 'utility.' This or that
arrangement is 'useful' because it enables us to get quickly and
easily at the evidence, to take effective securities for its
truthfulness, to estimate its relevance and importance, to leave the
decision to the most qualified persons, and so forth. These points,
again, can only be decided by a careful appeal to experience,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
and by
endeavouring to understand the ordinary play of 'motives' and
'sanctions.' What generally makes a man lie, and how is lying to be
made unpleasant? By rigorously fixing our minds at every point on such
issues, we find that many questions admit of very plain answers, and
are surprised to discover what a mass of obscurity has been dispelled.
It is, however, true that although the value of the method can hardly
be denied unless we deny the value of all experience and common sense,
we may dispute the degree in which it confirms the general principle.
Every step seems to Bentham to reflect additional light upon his
primary axiom. Yet it is possible to hold that witnesses should be
encouraged to speak the truth, and that experience may help us to
discover the best means to that end without, therefore, admitting the
unique validity of the 'greatest happiness' principle. That principle,
so far as true, may be itself a deduction from some higher principle;
and no philosopher of any school would deny that 'utility' should be
in some way consulted by the legislator.</p>

<p>The book illustrates the next critical point in Bentham's system&mdash;the
transition from law to politics. He was writing the book at the period
when the failure of the Panopticon was calling his attention to the
wickedness of George <small>III.</small> and Lord Eldon, and when the English demand
for parliamentary reform was reviving and supplying him with a
sympathetic audience. Now, in examining the theory of evidence upon
the plan described, Bentham found himself at every stage in conflict
with the existing system, or rather the existing chaos of
unintelligible rules. English lawyers, he discovered, had worked out a
system of rules for excluding evidence.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Sometimes the cause was pure
indolence. 'This man, were I to hear him,' says the English judge,
'would come out with a parcel of lies. It would be a plague to hear
him: I have heard enough already; shut the door in his face.'<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
But, as Bentham shows with elaborate detail, a reason for suspecting
evidence is not a reason for excluding it. A convicted perjurer gives
evidence, and has a pecuniary interest in the result. That is
excellent ground for caution; but the fact that the man makes a
certain statement may still be a help to the ascertainment of truth.
Why should that help be rejected? Bentham scarcely admits of any
exception to the general rule of taking any evidence you can get&mdash;one
exception being the rather curious one of confession to a Catholic
priest; secrecy in such cases is on the whole, he thinks, useful. He
exposes the confusion implied in an exclusion of evidence because it
is not fully trustworthy, which is equivalent to working in the dark
because a partial light may deceive. But this is only a part of a
whole system of arbitrary, inconsistent, and technical rules worked
out by the ingenuity of lawyers. Besides the direct injury they gave
endless opportunity for skilful man&oelig;uvring to exclude or admit
evidence by adopting different forms of procedure. Rules had been made
by judges as they were wanted and precedents established of
contradictory tendency and uncertain application. Bentham contrasts
the simplicity of the rules deducible from 'utility' with the amazing
complexity of the traditional code of technical rules. Under the
'natural' system, that of utility, you have to deal with a quarrel
between your servants or children. You
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
send at once for the
disputants, confront them, take any relevant evidence, and make up
your mind as to the rights of the dispute. In certain cases this
'natural' procedure has been retained, as, for example, in
courts-martial, where rapid decision was necessary. Had the technical
system prevailed, the country would have been ruined in six
weeks.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> But the exposure of the technical system requires an
elaborate display of intricate methods involving at every step
vexation, delay, and injustice. Bentham reckons up nineteen separate
devices employed by the courts. He describes the elaborate processes
which had to be gone through before a hearing could be obtained; the
distance of courts from the litigants; the bandying of cases from
court to court; the chicaneries about giving notice; the frequent
nullification of all that had been done on account of some technical
flaw; the unintelligible jargon of Latin and Law-French which veiled
the proceedings from the public; the elaborate mysteries of 'special
pleading'; the conflict of jurisdictions, and the manufacture of new
'pleas' and new technical rules; the 'entanglement of jurisdictions,'
and especially the distinction between law and equity, which had made
confusion doubly confounded. English law had become a mere jungle of
unintelligible distinctions, contradictions, and cumbrous methods
through which no man could find his way without the guidance of the
initiated, and in which a long purse and unscrupulous trickery gave
the advantage over the poor to the rich, and to the knave over the
honest man. One fruitful source of all these evils was the
'judge-made' law, which Bentham henceforth never ceased to denounce.
His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
ideal was a distinct code which, when change was required, should
be changed by an avowed and intelligible process. The chaos which had
grown up was the natural result of the gradual development of a
traditional body of law, in which new cases were met under cover of
applying precedents from previous decisions, with the help of
reference to the vague body of unwritten or 'common law,' and of legal
fictions permitting some non-natural interpretation of the old
formul&aelig;. It is the judges, he had already said in 1792,<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> 'that
make the common law. Do you know how they make it? Just as a man makes
laws for his dog. When your dog does anything you want to break him
of, you wait till he does it and then beat him. This is the way you
make laws for your dog, and this is the way the judges make laws for
you and me.' The 'tyranny of judge-made law' is 'the most
all-comprehensive, most grinding, and most crying of all
grievances,'<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> and is scarcely less bad than 'priest-made
religion.'<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Legal fictions, according to him, are simply lies. The
permission to use them is a 'mendacity licence.' In 'Rome-bred law ...
fiction' is a 'wart which here and there disfigures the face of
justice. In English law fiction is a syphilis which runs into every
vein and carries into every part of the system the principle of
rottenness.'<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>The evils denounced by Bentham were monstrous. The completeness of the
exposure was his great merit; and his reputation has suffered, as we
are told on competent authority, by the very efficiency of his attack.
The worst evils are so much things of the past, that we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
forget the
extent of the evil and the merits of its assailant. Bentham's
diagnosis of the evil explains his later attitude. He attributes all
the abuses to consciously corrupt motives even where a sufficient
explanation can be found in the human stupidity and honest incapacity
to look outside of traditional ways of thought. He admits, indeed, the
personal purity of English judges. No English judge had ever received
a bribe within living memory.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> But this, he urges, is only because
the judges find it more profitable as well as safer to carry out a
radically corrupt system. A synonym for 'technical' is
'fee-gathering.' Lawyers of all classes had a common interest in
multiplying suits and complicating procedure: and thus a tacit
partnership had grown up which he describes as 'Judge and Co.' He
gives statistics showing that in the year 1797 five hundred and
forty-three out of five hundred and fifty 'writs of error' were
'shams,' or simply vexatious contrivances for delay, and brought a
profit to the Chief Justice of over &pound;1400.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Lord Eldon was always
before him as the typical representative of obstruction and
obscurantism. In his <i>Indications respecting Lord Eldon</i> (1825) he
goes into details which it must have required some courage to publish.
Under Eldon, he says, 'equity has become an instrument of fraud and
extortion.'<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> He details the proceedings by which Eldon obtained
the sanction of parliament for a system of fee-taking, which he had
admitted to be illegal, and which had been denounced by an eminent
solicitor as leading to gross corruption. Bentham intimates that the
Masters in Chancery were 'swindlers,'<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> and that Eldon was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
knowingly the protector and sharer of their profits. Romilly, who had
called the Court of Chancery 'a disgrace to a civilised nation,' had
said that Eldon was the cause of many of the abuses, and could have
reformed most of the others. Erskine had declared that if there was a
hell, the Court of Chancery was hell.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Eldon, as Bentham himself
thought, was worse than Jeffreys. Eldon's victims had died a lingering
death, and the persecutor had made money out of their sufferings.
Jeffreys was openly brutal; while Eldon covered his tyranny under the
'most accomplished indifference.'<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>Yet Eldon was but the head of a band. Judges, barristers, and
solicitors were alike. The most hopeless of reforms would be to raise
a 'thorough-paced English lawyer' to the moral level of an average
man.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> To attack legal abuses was to attack a class combined under
its chiefs, capable of hoodwinking parliament and suppressing open
criticism. The slave-traders whom Wilberforce attacked were
comparatively a powerless excrescence. The legal profession was in the
closest relations to the monarchy, the aristocracy, and the whole
privileged and wealthy class. They were welded into a solid 'ring.'
The king, and his ministers who distributed places and pensions; the
borough-mongers who sold votes for power; the clergy who looked for
bishoprics; the monied men who aspired to rank and power, were all
parts of a league. It was easy enough to talk of law reform. Romilly
had proposed and even carried a 'reformatiuncle' or two;<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> but to
achieve a serious success required not victory in a skirmish or two,
not the exposure of some abuse too palpable to be openly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> defended
even by an Eldon, but a prolonged war against an organised army
fortified and entrenched in the very heart of the country.</p>

<p class="scs">VI. <a name="VI_VI" id="VI_VI"></a>RADICALISM</p>

<p>Thus Bentham, as his eyes were opened, became a Radical. The political
purpose became dominant, although we always see that the legal abuses
are uppermost in his mind; and that what he really seeks is a fulcrum
for the machinery which is to overthrow Lord Eldon. Some of the
pamphlets deal directly with the special instruments of corruption.
The <i>Elements of the Art of Packing</i> shows how the crown managed to
have a permanent body of special 'jurors' at its disposal. The 'grand
and paramount use'<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> of this system was to crush the liberty of the
press. The obscure law of libel, worked by judges in the interest of
the government, enabled them to punish any rash Radical for 'hurting
the feelings' of the ruling classes, and to evade responsibility by
help of a 'covertly pensioned' and servile jury. The pamphlet, though
tiresomely minute and long-winded, contained too much pointed truth to
be published at the time. The <i>Official Aptitude minimised</i> contains a
series of attacks upon the system of patronage and pensions by which
the machinery of government was practically worked. In the <i>Catechism</i>
of reformers, written in 1809, Bentham began the direct application of
his theories to the constitution; and the final and most elaborate
exposition of these forms the <i>Constitutional Code</i>, which was the
main work of his later years. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
book excited the warmest
admiration of Bentham's disciples.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> J. S. Mill speaks of its
'extraordinary power ... of at once seizing comprehensive principles
and scheming out minute details,' and of its 'surpassing intellectual
vigour.' Nor, indeed, will any one be disposed to deny that it is a
singular proof of intellectual activity, when we remember that it was
begun when the author was over seventy, and that he was still working
at eighty-four.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> In this book Bentham's peculiarities of style
reach their highest development, and it cannot be recommended as light
reading. Had Bentham been a mystical philosopher, he would, we may
conjecture, have achieved a masterpiece of unintelligibility which all
his followers would have extolled as containing the very essence of
his teaching. His method condemned him to be always intelligible,
however crabbed and elaborate. Perhaps, however, the point which
strikes one most is the amazing simple-mindedness of the whole
proceeding. Bentham's light-hearted indifference to the distinction
between paper constitutions and operative rules of conduct becomes
almost pathetic.</p>

<p>Bentham was clearly the victim of a common delusion. If a system will
work, the minutest details can be exhibited. Therefore, it is
inferred, an exhibition of minute detail proves that it will work.
Unfortunately, the philosophers of Laputa would have had no more
difficulty in filling up details than the legislators of England or
the United States. When Bentham had settled in his 'Radical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> Reform
Bill'<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> that the 'voting-box' was to be a double cube of cast-iron,
with a slit in the lid, into which cards two inches by one, white on
one side and black on the other, could be inserted, he must have felt
that he had got very near to actual application: he can picture the
whole operation and nobody can say that the scheme is impracticable
for want of working plans of the machinery. There will, doubtless, be
no difficulty in settling the shape of the boxes, when we have once
agreed to have the ballot. But a discussion of such remote details of
Utopia is of incomparably less real interest than the discussion in
the <i>Rationale of Evidence</i> of points, which, however minute, were
occurring every day, and which were really in urgent need of the light
of common sense.</p>

<p>Bentham's general principles may be very simply stated. They are, in
fact, such as were suggested by his view of legal grievances. Why,
when he had demonstrated that certain measures would contribute to the
'greatest happiness of the greatest number,' were they not at once
adopted? Because the rulers did not desire the greatest happiness of
the greatest number. This, in Bentham's language, is to say that they
were governed by a 'sinister interest.' Their interest was that of
their class, not that of the nation; they aimed at the greatest
happiness of some, not at the greatest happiness of all. A
generalisation of this remark gives us the first axioms of all
government. There are two primary principles: the 'self-preference'
principle, in virtue of which every man always desires his own
greatest happiness'; and the 'greatest happiness' principle, in virtue
of which 'the right and proper end' of government is the 'greatest
happiness of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the greatest number.'<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The 'actual end' of every
government, again, is the greatest happiness of the governors. Hence
the whole problem is to produce a coincidence of the two ends, by
securing an identity of interest between governors and governed. To
secure that we have only to identify the two classes or to put the
government in the hands of all.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> In a monarchy, the ruler aims at
the interest of one&mdash;himself; in a 'limited monarchy' the aim is at
the happiness of the king and the small privileged class; in a
democracy, the end is the right one&mdash;the greatest happiness of the
greatest number. This is a short cut to all constitutional questions.
Probably it has occurred in substance to most youthful members of
debating societies. Bentham's confidence in his logic lifts him above
any appeal to experience; and he occasionally reminds us of the proof
given in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> that the queen must live in the Tower of
London. The 'monarch,' as he observes,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> 'is naturally the very
worst&mdash;the most maleficent member of the whole community.' Wherever an
aristocracy differs from the democracy, their judgment will be
erroneous.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> The people will naturally choose 'morally apt agents,'
and men who wish to be chosen will desire truly to become 'morally
apt,' for they can only recommend themselves by showing their desire
to serve the general interest.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> 'All experience testifies to this
theory,' though the evidence is 'too bulky' to be given. Other
proofs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
however, may at once be rendered superfluous by appealing to
'the uninterrupted and most notorious experience of the United
States.'<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> To that happy country he often appeals indeed<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> as a
model government. In it, there is no corruption, no useless
expenditure, none of the evils illustrated by our 'matchless
constitution.'</p>

<p>The constitution deduced from these principles has at least the merit
of simplicity. We are to have universal suffrage, annual parliaments,
and vote by ballot. He inclines to give a vote to women.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> There is
to be no king, no house of peers, no established church. Members of
parliament are not to be re-eligible, till after an interval.
Elaborate rules provide for their regular attendance and exclusive
devotion to their masters' business. They are to be simply 'deputies,'
not 'representatives.' They elect a prime minister who holds office
for four years. Officials are to be appointed by a complex plan of
competitive examination; and they are to be invited to send in tenders
for doing the work at diminished salary. When once in office, every
care is taken for their continual inspection by the public and the
verification of their accounts. They are never for an instant to
forget that they are servants, not the masters, of the public.</p>

<p>Bentham, of course, is especially minute and careful in regard to the
judicial organisation&mdash;a subject upon which he wrote much, and much to
the purpose. The functions and fees of advocates are to be narrowly
restricted, and advocates to be provided gratuitously for the poor.
They are not to become judges: to make a barrister a judge is as
sensible as it would be to select
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
a procuress for mistress of a
girls' school.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Judges should be everywhere accessible: always on
duty, too busy to have time for corruption, and always under public
supervision. One characteristic device is his quasi-jury. The English
system of requiring unanimity was equivalent to enforcing perjury by
torture. Its utility as a means of resisting tyranny would disappear
when tyranny had become impossible. But public opinion might be
usefully represented by a 'quasi-jury' of three or five, who should
not pronounce a verdict, but watch the judge, interrogate, if
necessary, and in case of need demand a rehearing. Judges, of course,
were no longer to make law, but to propose amendments in the
'Pannomion' or universal code, when new cases arose.</p>

<p>His leading principle may be described in one word as
'responsibility,' or expressed in his leading rule, 'Minimise
Confidence.'<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> 'All government is in itself one vast evil.'<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> It
consists in applying evil to exclude worse evil. Even 'to reward is to
punish,'<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> when reward is given by government. The less government,
then, the better; but as governors are a necessary evil, they must be
limited by every possible device to the sole legitimate aim, and
watched at every turn by the all-seeing eye of public opinion. Every
one must admit that this is an application of a sound principle, and
that one condition of good government is the diffusion of universal
responsibility. It must be admitted, too, that Bentham's theory
represents a vigorous embodiment and unflinching application of
doctrines which since his time have spread and gained more general
authority.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Mill says that granting one assumption, the Constitutional
Code is 'admirable.'<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> That assumption is that it is for the good
of mankind to be under the absolute authority of a majority. In other
words, it would justify what Mill calls the 'despotism of public
opinion.' To protest against that despotism was one of the main
purposes of Mill's political writings. How was it that the disciple
came to be in such direct opposition to his master? That question
cannot be answered till we have considered Mill's own position. But I
have now followed Bentham far enough to consider the more general
characteristics of his doctrine.</p>

<p>I have tried, in the first place, to show what was the course of
Bentham's own development; how his observation of certain legal abuses
led him to attempt the foundation of a science of jurisprudence; how
the difficulty of obtaining a hearing for his arguments led him to
discover the power of 'Judge and Co.'; how he found out that behind
'Judge and Co.' were George <small>III.</small> and the base Sidmouth, and the whole
band of obstructors entrenched within the 'matchless constitution';
and how thus his attack upon the abuses of the penal law led him to
attack the whole political framework of the country. I have also tried
to show how Bentham's development coincided with that of the English
reformers generally. They too began with attacking specific abuses.
They were for 'reform, not revolution.' The constitution satisfied
them in the main: they boasted of the palladia of their liberties,
'trial by jury' and the 'Habeas Corpus' Act, and held Frenchmen to be
frog-eating slaves in danger of <i>lettres de cachet</i> and the Bastille.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
English public opinion in spite of many trammels had a potent
influence. Their first impulse, therefore, was simply to get rid of
the trammels&mdash;the abuses which had grown up from want of a thorough
application of the ancient principles in their original purity. The
English Whig, even of the more radical persuasion, was profoundly
convinced that the foundations were sound, however unsatisfactory
might be the superstructure. Thus, both Bentham and the reformers
generally started&mdash;not from abstract principles, but from the assault
upon particular abuses. This is the characteristic of the whole
English movement, and gives the meaning of their claim to be
'practical.' The Utilitarians were the reformers on the old lines; and
their philosophy meant simply a desire to systematise the ordinary
common sense arguments. The philosophy congenial to this vein is the
philosophy which appeals to experience. Locke had exploded 'innate
ideas.' They denounced 'intuitions,' or beliefs which might override
experience as 'innate ideas' in a new dress; and the attempt to carry
out this view systematically became the distinctive mark of the whole
school. Bentham accepted, though he did little to elaborate, this
doctrine. That task remained for his disciples. But the tendency is
shown by his view of a rival version of Radicalism.</p>

<p>Bentham, as we have seen, regarded the American Declaration of
Independence as so much 'jargon.' He was entirely opposed to the
theory of the 'rights of man,' and therefore to the 'ideas of 1789.'
From that theory the revolutionary party professed to deduce their
demands for universal suffrage, the levelling of all privileges, and
the absolute supremacy of the people. Yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
Bentham, repudiating the
premises, came to accept the conclusion. His Constitutional Code
scarcely differs from the ideal of the Jacobins', except in pushing
the logic further. The machinery by which he proposed to secure that
the so-called rulers should become really the servants of the people
was more thoroughgoing and minutely worked out than that of any
democratic constitution that has ever been adopted. How was it that
two antagonist theories led to identical results; and that the 'rights
of man,' absurd in philosophy, represented the ideal state of things
in practice?</p>

<p>The general answer may be that political theories are not really based
upon philosophy. The actual method is to take your politics for
granted on the one side and your philosophy for granted on the other,
and then to prove their necessary connection. But it is, at any rate,
important to see what was the nature of the philosophical assumptions
implicitly taken for granted by Bentham.</p>

<p>The 'rights of man' doctrine confounds a primary logical canon with a
statement of fact. Every political theory must be based upon facts as
well as upon logic. Any reasonable theory about politics must no doubt
give a reason for inequality and a reason, too, for equality. The
maxim that all men were, or ought to be, 'equal' asserts correctly
that there must not be arbitrary differences. Every inequality should
have its justification in a reasonable system. But when this
undeniable logical canon is taken to prove that men actually are
equal, there is an obvious begging of the question. In point of fact,
the theorists immediately proceeded to disfranchise half the race on
account of sex, and a third of the remainder on account of infancy.
They could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
only amend the argument by saying that all men were equal
in so far as they possessed certain attributes. But those attributes
could only be determined by experience, or, as Bentham would have put
it, by an appeal to 'utility.' It is illogical, said the anti-slavery
advocate, to treat men differently on account of the colour of their
skins. No doubt it is illogical if, in fact, the difference of colour
does not imply a difference of the powers which fit a man for the
enjoyment of certain rights. We may at least grant that the burden of
proof should be upon those who would disfranchise all red-haired men.
But this is because experience shows that the difference of colour
does not mark a relevant difference. We cannot say, <i>a priori</i>,
whether the difference between a negro and a white man may not be so
great as to imply incapacity for enjoyment of equal rights. The black
skin might&mdash;for anything a mere logician can say&mdash;indicate the mind of
a chimpanzee. The case against slavery does not rest on the bare fact
that negroes and whites both belong to the class 'man,' but on the
fact that the negro has powers and sensibilities which fit him to hold
property, to form marriages, to learn his letters, and so forth. But
that fact is undeniably to be proved, not from the bare logic, but
from observation of the particular case.</p>

<p>Bentham saw with perfect clearness that sound political theory
requires a basis of solid fact. The main purpose of his whole system
was to carry out that doctrine thoroughly. His view is given
vigorously in the 'Anarchical Fallacies'&mdash;a minute examination of the
French Declaration of Rights in 1791. His argument is of merciless
length, and occasionally so minute as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
sound like quibbling. The
pith, however, is clear enough. 'All men are born and remain free and
equal in respect of rights' are the first words of the Declaration.
Nobody is 'born free,' retorts Bentham. Everybody is born, and long
remains, a helpless child. All men born free! Absurd and miserable
nonsense! Why, you are complaining in the same breath that nearly
everybody is a slave.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> To meet this objection, the words might be
amended by substituting 'ought to be' for 'is.' This, however, on
Bentham's showing, at once introduces the conception of utility, and
therefore leads to empirical considerations. The proposition, when
laid down as a logical necessity, claims to be absolute. Therefore it
implies that all authority is bad; the authority, for example, of
parent over child, or of husband over wife; and moreover, that all
laws to the contrary are <i>ipso facto</i> void. That is why it is
'anarchical.' It supposes a 'natural right,' not only as suggesting
reasons for proposed alterations of the legal right, but as actually
annihilating the right and therefore destroying all government.
'<i>Natural rights</i>,' says Bentham,<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> is simple nonsense; natural and
imprescriptible rights 'rhetorical nonsense&mdash;nonsense upon stilts.'
For 'natural right' substitute utility, and you have, of course, a
reasonable principle, because an appeal to experience. But lay down
'liberty' as an absolute right and you annihilate law, for every law
supposes coercion. One man gets liberty simply by restricting the
liberty of others.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> What Bentham substantially says, therefore, is
that on this version absolute rights of individuals could mean nothing
but anarchy; or that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
no law can be defended except by a reference to
facts, and therefore to 'utility.'</p>

<p>One answer might be that the demand is not for absolute liberty, but
for as much liberty as is compatible with equal liberty for all. The
fourth article of the Declaration says: 'Liberty consists in being
able to do that which is not hurtful to another, and therefore the
exercise of the natural rights of each man has no other bounds than
those which ensure to the other members of the society the enjoyment
of the same rights.' This formula corresponds to a theory held by Mr.
Herbert Spencer; and, as he observes,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> held on different grounds
by Kant. Bentham's view, indicated by his criticism of this article in
the 'Anarchical Fallacies,' is therefore worth a moment's notice. The
formula does not demand the absolute freedom which would condemn all
coercion and all government; but it still seems to suggest that
liberty, not utility, is the ultimate end. Bentham's formula,
therefore, diverges. All government, he holds, is an evil, because
coercion implies pain. We must therefore minimise, though we cannot
annihilate, government; but we must keep to utility as the sole test.
Government should, of course, give to the individual all such rights
as are 'useful'; but it does not follow, without a reference to
utility, that men should not be restrained even in 'self-regarding'
conduct. Some men, women, and children require to be protected against
the consequences of their own 'weakness, ignorance, or
imprudence.'<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Bentham adheres, that is, to the strictly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> empirical
ground. The absolute doctrine requires to be qualified by a reference
to actual circumstances: and, among those circumstances, as Bentham
intimates, we must include the capacity of the persons concerned to
govern themselves. Carried out as an absolute principle, it would
imply the independence of infants; and must therefore require some
reference to 'utility.'</p>

<p>Bentham, then, objects to the Jacobin theory as too absolute and too
'individualist.' The doctrine begs the question; it takes for granted
what can only be proved by experience; and therefore lays down as
absolute theories which are only true under certain conditions or with
reference to the special circumstances to which they are applied. That
is inconsistent with Bentham's thoroughgoing empiricism. But he had
antagonists to meet upon the other side: and, in meeting them, he was
led to a doctrine which has been generally condemned for the very same
faults&mdash;as absolute and individualist. We have only to ask in what
sense Bentham appealed to 'experience' to see how he actually reached
his conclusions. The adherents of the old tradition appealed to
experience in their own way. The English people, they said, is the
freest, richest, happiest in the world; it has grown up under the
British Constitution: therefore the British Constitution is the best
in the world, as Burke tells you, and the British common law, as
Blackstone tells you, is the 'perfection of wisdom.' Bentham's reply
was virtually that although he, like Burke, appealed to experience, he
appealed to experience scientifically organised, whereas Burke
appealed to mere blind tradition. Bentham is to be the founder of a
new science, founded like chemistry on experiment,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
and his methods
are to be as superior to those of Burke as those of modern chemists to
those of the alchemists who also invoked experience. The true plan was
not to throw experience aside because it was alleged by the ignorant
and the prejudiced, but to interrogate experience systematically, and
so to become the Bacon or the Newton of legislation, instead of
wandering off into the <i>a priori</i> constructions of a Descartes or a
Leibniz.</p>

<p>Bentham thus professes to use an 'inductive' instead of the deductive
method of the Jacobins; but reaches the same practical conclusions
from the other end. The process is instructive. He objected to the
existing inequalities, not as inequalities simply, but as mischievous
inequalities. He, as well as the Jacobins, would admit that inequality
required justification; and he agreed with them that, in this case,
there was no justification. The existing privileges did not promote
the 'greatest happiness of the greatest number.' The attack upon the
'Anarchical Fallacies' must be taken with the <i>Book of Fallacies</i>, and
the <i>Book of Fallacies</i> is a sustained and vigorous, though a
curiously cumbrous, assault upon the Conservative arguments. Its pith
may be found in Sydney Smith's <i>Noodle's Oration</i>; but it is itself
well worth reading by any one who can recognise really admirable
dialectical power, and forgive a little crabbedness of style in
consideration of genuine intellectual vigour. I only notice Bentham's
assault upon the 'wisdom of our ancestors.' After pointing out how
much better we are entitled to judge now that we have got rid of so
many superstitions, and have learned to read and write, he replies to
the question, 'Would you have us speak and act as if we never had any
ancestors?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
'By no means,' he replies; 'though their opinions were of
little value, their practice is worth attending to; but chiefly
because it shows the bad consequences of their opinions.' 'From
foolish opinion comes foolish conduct; from foolish conduct the
severest disaster; and from the severest disaster the most useful
warning. It is from the folly, not from the wisdom, of our ancestors
that we have so much to learn.'<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Bentham has become an 'ancestor,'
and may teach us by his errors. Pointed and vigorous as is his
exposure of many of the sophistries by which Conservatives defended
gross abuses and twisted the existence of any institution into an
argument for its value, we get some measure from this of Bentham's
view of history. In attacking an abuse, he says, we have a right to
inquire into the utility of any and every arrangement. The purpose of
a court of justice is to decide litigation; it has to ascertain facts
and apply rules: does it then ascertain facts by the methods most
conducive to the discovery of truth? Are the rules needlessly complex,
ambiguous, calculated to give a chance to knaves, or to the longest
purse? If so, undoubtedly they are mischievous. Bentham had done
inestimable service in stripping away all the disguises and technical
phrases which had evaded the plain issue, and therefore made of the
laws an unintelligible labyrinth. He proceeded to treat in the same
way of government generally. Does it work efficiently for its
professed ends? Is it worked in the interests of the nation, or of a
special class, whose interests conflict with those of the nation? He
treated, that is, of government as a man of business might investigate
a commercial undertaking.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> If he found that clerks were lazy,
ignorant, making money for themselves, or bullying and cheating the
customers, he would condemn the management. Bentham found the
'matchless constitution' precisely in this state. He condemned
political institutions worked for the benefit of a class, and leading,
especially in legal matters, to endless abuses and chicanery. The
abuses everywhere imply 'inequality' in some sense; for they arise
from monopoly. The man who holds a sinecure, or enjoys a privilege,
uses it for his own private interest. The 'matter of corruption,' as
Bentham called it, was provided by the privilege and the sinecure. The
Jacobin might denounce privileges simply as privileges, and Bentham
denounce them because they were used by the privileged class for
corrupt purposes. So far, Bentham and the Jacobins were quite at one.
It mattered little to the result which argument they preferred to use,
and without doubt they had a very strong case, and did in fact express
a demand for justice and for a redress of palpable evils. The
difference seems to be that in one case the appeal is made in the name
of justice and equality; in the other case, in the name of benevolence
and utility.</p>

<p>The important point here, however, is to understand Bentham's implicit
assumptions. J. S. Mill, in criticising his master, points out very
forcibly the defects arising from Bentham's attitude to history. He
simply continued, as Mill thinks, the hostility with which the
critical or destructive school of the eighteenth century regarded
their ancestors. To the revolutionary party history was a record of
crimes and follies and of little else. The question will meet us
again; and here it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
enough to ask what is the reason of his tacit
implication of Bentham's position. Bentham's whole aim, as I have
tried to show, was to be described as the construction of a science of
legislation. The science, again, was to be purely empirical. It was to
rest throughout upon the observation of facts. That aim&mdash;an admirable
aim&mdash;runs through his whole work and that of his successors. I have
noticed, indeed, how easily Bentham took for granted that his
makeshift classification of common motives amounted to a scientific
psychology. A similar assumption that a rough sketch of a science is
the same thing as its definite constitution is characteristic of the
Utilitarians in general. A scientific spirit is most desirable; but
the Utilitarians took a very short cut to scientific certainty. Though
appealing to experience, they reach formul&aelig; as absolute as any
'intuitionist' could desire. What is the logical process implied? To
constitute an empirical science is to show that the difference between
different phenomena is due simply to 'circumstances.' The explanation
of the facts becomes sufficient when the 'law' can be stated, as that
of a unit of constant properties placed in varying positions. This
corresponds to the procedure in the physical sciences, where the
ultimate aim is to represent all laws as corresponding to the changes
of position of uniform atoms. In social and political changes the goal
is the same. J. S. Mill states in the end of his <i>Autobiography</i><a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
that one main purpose of his writing was to show that 'differences
between individuals, races, or sexes' are due to 'differences in
circumstances.' In fact, this is an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
aim so characteristic from the
beginning of the whole school, that it may be put down almost as a
primary postulate. It was not, indeed, definitely formulated; but to
'explain' a social theorem was taken to be the same thing as to show
how differences of character or conduct could be explained by
'circumstance'&mdash;meaning by 'circumstance' something not given in the
agent himself. We have, however, no more right as good empiricists to
assert than to deny that all difference comes from 'circumstance.' If
we take 'man' as a constant quantity in our speculations, it requires
at least a great many precautions before we can assume that our
abstract entity corresponds to a real concrete unit. Otherwise we have
a short cut to a doctrine of 'equality.' The theory of 'the rights of
man' lays down the formula, and assumes that the facts will
correspond. The Utilitarian assumes the equality of fact, and of
course brings out an equally absolute formula. 'Equality,' in some
sense, is introduced by a side wind, though not explicitly laid down
as an axiom.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> This underlying tendency may partly explain the
coincidence of results&mdash;though it would require a good many
qualifications in detail; but here I need only take Bentham's more or
less unconscious application.</p>

<p>Bentham's tacit assumption, in fact, is that there is an average
'man.' Different specimens of the race, indeed, may vary widely
according to age, sex, and so forth; but, for purposes of legislation,
he may serve as a unit. We can assume that he has on the average
certain qualities from which his actions in the mass can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> be
determined with sufficient accuracy, and we are tempted to assume that
they are mainly the qualities obvious to an inhabitant of Queen's
Square Place about the year 1800. Mill defends Bentham against the
charge that he assumed his codes to be good for all men everywhere. To
that, says Mill,<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> the essay upon the 'Influence of Time and Place
in Matters of Legislation' is a complete answer. Yet Mill<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> admits
in the same breath that Bentham omitted all reference to 'national
character.' In fact, as we have seen, Bentham was ready to legislate
for Hindoostan as well as for his own parish; and to make codes not
only for England, Spain, and Russia, but for Morocco. The Essay
mentioned really explains the point. Bentham not only admitted but
asserted as energetically as became an empiricist, that we must allow
for 'circumstances'; and circumstances include not only climate and so
forth, but the varying beliefs and customs of the people under
consideration. The real assumption is that all such circumstances are
superficial, and can be controlled and altered indefinitely by the
'legislator.' The Moor, the Hindoo, and the Englishman are all
radically identical; and the differences which must be taken into
account for the moment can be removed by judicious means. Without
pausing to illustrate this from the Essay, I may remark that for many
purposes such an assumption is justifiable and guides ordinary common
sense. If we ask what would be the best constitution for a commercial
company, or the best platform for a political party, we can form a
fair guess by arguing from the average of Bentham and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
contemporaries&mdash;especially if we are shrewd attornies or political
wirepullers. Only we are not therefore in a position to talk about the
'science of human nature' or to deal with problems of 'sociology.'
This, however, gives Bentham's 'individualism' in a sense of the
phrase already explained. He starts from the 'ready-made man,' and
deduces all institutions or legal arrangements from his properties. I
have tried to show how naturally this view fell in with the ordinary
political conceptions of the time. It shows, again, why Bentham
disregards history. When we have such a science, empirical or <i>a
priori</i>, history is at most of secondary importance. We can deduce all
our maxims of conduct from the man himself as he is before us. History
only shows how terribly he blundered in the pre-scientific period. The
blunders may give us a hint here and there. Man was essentially the
same in the first and the eighteenth century, and the differences are
due to the clumsy devices which he made by rule of thumb. We do not
want to refer to them now, except as illustrations of errors. We may
remark how difficult it was to count before the present notation was
invented; but when it has once been invented, we may learn to use it
without troubling our heads about our ancestors' clumsy contrivances
for doing without it. This leads to the real shortcoming. There is a
point at which the historical view becomes important&mdash;the point,
namely, where it is essential to remember that man is not a ready-made
article, but the product of a long and still continuing 'evolution.'
Bentham's attack (in the <i>Fragment</i>) upon the 'social contract' is
significant. He was, no doubt, perfectly right in saying that an
imaginary contract could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
add no force to the ultimate grounds for the
social union. Nobody would now accept the fiction in that stage. And
yet the 'social contract' may be taken to recognise a fact; namely,
that the underlying instincts upon which society alternately rests
correspond to an order of reasons from those which determine more
superficial relations. Society is undoubtedly useful, and its utility
may be regarded as its ground. But the utility of society means much
more than the utility of a railway company or a club, which postulates
as existing a whole series of already established institutions. To
Bentham an 'utility' appeared to be a kind of permanent and ultimate
entity which is the same at all periods&mdash;it corresponds to a
psychological currency of constant value. To show, therefore, that the
social contract recognises 'utility' is to show that the whole
organism is constructed just as any particular part is constructed.
Man comes first and 'society' afterwards. I have already noticed how
this applies to his statements about the utility of a law; how his
argument assumes an already constituted society, and seems to overlook
the difference between the organic law upon which all order
essentially depends, and some particular modification or corollary
which may be superinduced. We now have to notice the political version
of the same method. The 'law,' according to Bentham, is a rule
enforced by a 'sanction.' The imposer of the rule in the phrase which
Hobbes had made famous is the 'sovereign.' Hobbes was a favourite
author, indeed, of the later Utilitarians, though Bentham does not
appear to have studied him. The relation is one of natural affinity.
When in the <i>Constitutional Code</i> Bentham transfers the 'sovereignty'
from the king to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the 'people,'<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> he shows the exact difference
between his doctrine and that of the <i>Leviathan</i>. Both thinkers are
absolutists in principle, though Hobbes gives to a monarch the power
which Bentham gives to a democracy. The attributes remain though their
subject is altered. The 'sovereign,' in fact, is the keystone of the
whole Utilitarian system. He represents the ultimate source of all
authority, and supplies the motive for all obedience. As Hobbes put
it, he is a kind of mortal God.</p>

<p>Mill's criticism of Bentham suggests the consequences. There are, he
says,<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> three great questions: What government is for the good of
the people? How are they to be induced to obey it? How is it to be
made responsible? The third question, he says, is the only one
seriously considered by Bentham; and Bentham's answer, we have seen,
leads to that 'tyranny of the majority' which was Mill's great
stumbling-block. Why, then, does Bentham omit the other questions? or
rather, how would he answer them? for he certainly assumes an answer.
People, in the first place, are 'induced to obey' by the sanctions.
They don't rob that they may not go to prison. That is a sufficient
answer at a given moment. It assumes, indeed, that the law will be
obeyed. The policeman, the gaoler, and the judge will do what the
sovereign&mdash;whether despot or legislature&mdash;orders them to do. The
jurist may naturally take this for granted. He does not go 'behind the
law.' That is the law which the sovereign has declared to be the law.
In that sense, the sovereign is omnipotent. He can, as a fact,
threaten evildoers with the gallows; and the jurist simply takes the
fact for granted, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
assumes that the coercion is an ultimate fact.
No doubt it is ultimate for the individual subject. The immediate
restraint is the policeman, and we need not ask upon what does the
policeman depend. If, however, we persist in asking, we come to the
historical problems which Bentham simply omits. The law itself, in
fact, ultimately rests upon 'custom,'&mdash;upon the whole system of
instincts, beliefs, and passions which induce people to obey
government, and are, so to speak, the substance out of which loyalty
and respect for the law is framed. These, again, are the product of an
indefinitely long elaboration, which Bentham takes for granted. He
assumes as perfectly natural and obvious that a number of men should
meet, as the Americans or Frenchmen met, and create a constitution.
That the possibility of such a proceeding involves centuries of
previous training does not occur to him. It is assumed that the
constitution can be made out of hand, and this assumption is of the
highest importance, not only historically, but for immediate practice.
Mill assumes too easily that Bentham has secured responsibility.
Bentham assumes that an institution will work as it is intended to
work&mdash;perhaps the commonest error of constitution-mongers. If the
people use the instruments which he provides, they have a legal method
for enforcing obedience. To infer that they will do so is to infer
that all the organic instincts will operate precisely as he intends;
that each individual, for example, will form an independent opinion
upon legislative questions, vote for men who will apply his opinions,
and see that his representatives perform his bidding honestly. That
they should do so is essential to his scheme; but that they will do so
is what he takes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
for granted. He assumes, that is, that there is no
need for inquiring into the social instincts which lie beneath all
political action. You can make your machine and assume the moving
force. That is the natural result of considering political and
legislative problems without taking into account the whole character
of the human materials employed in the construction. Bentham's
sovereign is thus absolute. He rules by coercion, as a foreign power
may rule by the sword in a conquered province. Thus, force is the
essence of government, and it is needless to go further. To secure the
right application of the force, we have simply to distribute it among
the subjects. Government still means coercion, and ultimately nothing
else; but then, as the subjects are simply moved by their own
interests, that is, by utility, they will apply the power to secure
those interests. Therefore, all that is wanted is this distribution,
and Mill's first problem, What government is for the good of the
people? is summarily answered. The question, how obedience is to be
secured, is evaded by confining the answer to the 'sanctions,' and
taking for granted that the process of distributing power is perfectly
simple, or that a new order can be introduced as easily as parliament
can pass an act for establishing a new police in London. The 'social
contract' is abolished; but it is taken for granted that the whole
power of the sovereign can be distributed, and rules made for its
application by the common sense of the various persons interested.
Finally, the one bond outside of the individual is the sovereign. He
represents all that holds society together; his 'sanctions,' as I have
said, are taken to be on the same plane with the 'moral
sanctions'&mdash;not dependent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
upon them, but other modes of applying
similar motives. As the sovereign, again, is in a sense omnipotent,
and yet can be manufactured, so to speak, by voluntary arrangements
among the individual members of society, there is no limit to the
influence which he may exercise. I note, indeed, that I am speaking
rather of the tendencies of the theory than of definitely formulated
conclusions. Most of the Utilitarians were exceedingly shrewd,
practical people, whose regard for hard facts imposed limits upon
their speculations. They should have been the last people to believe
too implicitly in the magical efficacy of political contrivances, for
they were fully aware that many men are knaves and most men fools.
They probably put little faith in Bentham's Utopia, except as a remote
ideal, and an ideal of unimaginative minds. The Utopia was constructed
on 'individualist' principles, because common sense naturally approves
individualism. The whole social and political order is clearly the sum
of the individuals, who combine to form an aggregate; and theories
about social bonds take one to the mystical and sentimental. The
absolute tendency is common to Bentham and the Jacobins. Whether the
individual be taken as a unit of constant properties, or as the
subject of absolute rights, we reach equally absolute conclusions.
When all the social and political regulations are regarded as
indefinitely modifiable, the ultimate laws come to depend upon the
absolute framework of unalterable fact. This, again, is often the
right point of view for immediate questions in which we may take for
granted that the average individual is in fact constant; and, as I
have said in regard to Bentham's legislative process, leads to very
relevant and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
important, though not ultimate, questions. But there are
certain other results which require to be noticed. 'Individualism,'
like other words that have become watchwords of controversy, has
various shades of meaning, and requires a little more definition.</p>

<p class="scs">VII. <a name="VI_VII" id="VI_VII"></a>INDIVIDUALISM</p>

<p>'Individualism' in the first place is generally mentioned in a
different connection. The 'ready-made' man of whom I have spoken
becomes the 'economic man.' Bentham himself contributed little to
economic theory. His most important writing was the <i>Defence of
Usury</i>, and in this, as we have seen, he was simply adding a corollary
to the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>. The <i>Wealth of Nations</i> itself represented
the spirit of business; the revolt of men who were building up a vast
industrial system against the fetters imposed by traditional
legislation and by rulers who regarded industry in general, as Telford
is said to have regarded rivers. Rivers were meant to supply canals,
and trade to supply tax-gatherers. With this revolt, of course,
Bentham was in full sympathy, but here I shall only speak of one
doctrine of great interest, which occurs both in his political
treatises and his few economical remarks. Bentham objected, as we have
seen, to the abstract theory of equality; yet it was to the mode of
deduction rather than to the doctrine itself which he objected. He
gave, in fact, his own defence; and it is one worth notice.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> The
principle of equality is derivative, not ultimate. Equality is good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
because equality increases the sum of happiness. Thus, as he
says,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> if two men have &pound;1000, and you transfer &pound;500 from one to
the other, you increase the recipient's wealth by one-third, and
diminish the loser's wealth by one-half. You therefore add less
pleasure than you subtract. The principle is given less
mathematically<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> by the more significant argument that 'felicity'
depends not simply on the 'matter of felicity' or the stimulus, but
also on the sensibility to felicity which is necessarily limited.
Therefore by adding wealth&mdash;taking, for example, from a thousand
labourers to give to one king&mdash;you are supersaturating a sensibility
already glutted by taking away from others a great amount of real
happiness. With this argument, which has of late years become
conspicuous in economics, he connects another of primary importance.
The first condition of happiness, he says, is not 'equality' but
'security.' Now you can only equalise at the expense of security. If I
am to have my property taken away whenever it is greater than my
neighbour's, I can have no security.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> Hence, if the two principles
conflict, equality should give way. Security is the primary, which
must override the secondary, aim. Must the two principles, then,
always conflict? No; but 'time is the only mediator.'<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> The law may
help to accumulate inequalities; but in a prosperous state there is a
'continual progress towards equality.' The law has to stand aside; not
to maintain monopolies; not to restrain trade; not to permit entails;
and then property will diffuse itself by a natural process, already
exemplified in the growth of Europe. The 'pyramids'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> heaped up in
feudal times have been lowered, and their '<i>d&eacute;bris</i> spread abroad'
among the industrious. Here again we see how Bentham virtually
diverges from the <i>a priori</i> school. Their absolute tendencies would
introduce 'equality' by force; he would leave it to the spontaneous
progress of security. Hence Bentham is in the main an adherent of what
he calls<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> the '<i>laissez-nous faire</i>' principle. He advocates it
most explicitly in the so-called <i>Manual of Political Economy</i>&mdash;a
short essay first printed in 1798.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> The tract, however, such as it
is, is less upon political economy proper than upon economic
legislation; and its chief conclusion is that almost all legislation
is improper. His main principle is 'Be quiet' (the equivalent of the
French phrase, which surely should have been excluded from so English
a theory). Security and freedom are all that industry requires; and
industry should say to government only what Diogenes said to
Alexander, 'Stand out of my sunshine.'<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>Once more, however, Bentham will not lay down the 'let alone'
principle absolutely. His adherence to the empirical method is too
decided. The doctrine 'be quiet,' though generally true, rests upon
utility, and may, therefore, always be qualified by proving that in a
particular case the balance of utility is the other way. In fact, some
of Bentham's favourite projects would be condemned by an absolute
adherent of the doctrine. The Panopticon, for example, though a 'mill
to grind rogues honest' could be applied to others than rogues, and
Bentham hoped to make his machinery equally effective in the case of
pauperism. A system of national education is also included in his
ideal constitution. It is, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> fact, important to remember that the
'individualism' of Benthamism does not necessarily coincide with an
absolute restriction of government interference. The general tendency
was in that direction; and in purely economical questions, scarcely
any exception was admitted to the rule. Men are the best judges, it
was said, of their own interest; and the interference of rulers in a
commercial transaction is the interference of people inferior in
knowledge of the facts, and whose interests are 'sinister' or
inconsistent with those of the persons really concerned. Utility,
therefore, will, as a rule, forbid the action of government: but, as
utility is always the ultimate principle, and there may be cases in
which it does not coincide with the 'let alone' principle, we must
always admit the possibility that in special cases government can
interfere usefully, and, in that case, approve the interference.</p>

<p>Hence we have the ethical application of these theories. The
individualist position naturally tends to take the form of egoism. The
moral sentiments, whatever they may be, are clearly an intrinsic part
of the organic social instincts. They are intimately involved in the
whole process of social evolution. But this view corresponds precisely
to the conditions which Bentham overlooks. The individual is already
there. The moral and the legal sanctions are 'external'; something
imposed by the action of others; corresponding to 'coercion,' whether
by physical force or the dread of public opinion; and, in any case, an
accretion or addition, not a profound modification of his whole
nature. The Utilitarian 'man' therefore inclines to consider other
people as merely parts of the necessary machinery. Their feelings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> are
relevant only as influencing their outward conduct. If a man gives me
a certain 'lot' of pain or pleasure, it does not matter what may be
his motives. The 'motive' for all conduct corresponds in all cases to
the pain or pleasure accruing to the agent. It is true that his
happiness will be more or less affected by his relations to others.
But as conduct is ruled by a calculation of the balance of pains or
pleasures dependent upon any course of action, it simplifies matters
materially, if each man regards his neighbour's feelings simply as
instrumental, not intrinsically interesting. And thus the coincidence
between that conduct which maximises my happiness and that conduct
which maximises happiness in general, must be regarded as more or less
accidental or liable in special cases to disappear. If I am made
happier by action which makes others miserable, the rule of utility
will lead to my preference of myself.</p>

<p>Here we have the question whether the Utilitarian system be
essentially a selfish system. Bentham, with his vague psychology, does
not lay down the doctrine absolutely. After giving this list of
self-regarding 'springs of action,' he proceeds to add the pleasures
and pains of 'sympathy' and 'antipathy' which, he says, are not
self-regarding. Moreover, as we have seen, he has some difficulty in
denying that 'benevolence' is a necessarily moral motive: it is only
capable of prompting to bad conduct in so far as it is insufficiently
enlightened; and it is clear that a moralist who makes the 'greatest
happiness of the greatest number' his universal test, has some reason
for admitting as an elementary pleasure the desire for the greatest
happiness. This comes out curiously in the <i>Constitutional Code</i>. He
there lays down the 'self-preference principle'&mdash;the principle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
namely, that 'every human being' is determined in every action by his
judgment of what will produce the greatest happiness to himself,
'whatsoever be the effect ... in relation to the happiness of other
similar beings, any or all of them taken together.'<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Afterwards,
however, he observes that it is 'the constant and arduous task of
every moralist' and of every legislator who deserves the name to
'increase the influence of sympathy at the expense of that of
self-regard and of sympathy for the greater number at the expense of
sympathy for the lesser number.'<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> He tries to reconcile these
views by the remark 'that even sympathy has its root in self-regard,'
and he argues, as Mr. Herbert Spencer has done more fully, that if
Adam cared only for Eve and Eve only for Adam&mdash;neither caring at all
for himself or herself&mdash;both would perish in less than a year.
Self-regard, that is, is essential, and sympathy supposes its
existence. Hence Bentham puts himself through a catechism.<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> What
is the 'best' government? That which causes the greatest happiness of
the given community. What community? 'Any community, which is as much
as to say, every community.' But <i>why</i> do you desire this happiness?
Because the establishment of that happiness would contribute to <i>my</i>
greatest happiness. And <i>how</i> do you prove that you desire this
result? By my labours to obtain it, replies Bentham. This oddly omits
the more obvious question, how can you be sure that your happiness
will be promoted by the greatest happiness of all? What if the two
criteria differ? I desire the general happiness, he might have
replied, because my benevolence is an original or elementary instinct
which can override my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
self-love; or I desire it, he would perhaps
have said, because I know as a fact that the happiness of others will
incidentally contribute to my own. The first answer would fall in with
some of his statements; but the second is, as I think must be
admitted, more in harmony with his system. Perhaps, indeed, the most
characteristic thing is Bentham's failure to discuss explicitly the
question whether human action is or is not necessarily 'selfish.' He
tells us in regard to the 'springs of action' that all human action is
always 'interested,' but explains that the word properly includes
actions in which the motive is not 'self-regarding.'<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> It merely
means, in fact, that all conduct has motives. The statement, which I
have quoted about the 'self-preference' principle may only mean a
doctrine which is perfectly compatible with a belief in
'altruism'&mdash;the doctrine, namely, that as a fact most people are
chiefly interested by their own affairs. The legislator, he tells us,
should try to increase sympathy, but the less he takes sympathy for
the 'basis of his arrangements'&mdash;that is, the less call he makes upon
purely unselfish motives&mdash;the greater will be his success.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> This
is a shrewd and, I should say, a very sound remark, but it
implies&mdash;not that all motives are selfish in the last analysis,
but&mdash;that the legislation should not assume too exalted a level of
ordinary morality. The utterances in the very unsatisfactory
<i>Deontology</i> are of little value, and seem to imply a moral sentiment
corresponding to a petty form of commonplace prudence.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
Leaving this point, however, the problem necessarily presented itself
to Bentham in a form in which selfishness is the predominating force,
and any recognition of independent benevolence rather an incumbrance
than a help. If we take the 'self-preference principle' absolutely,
the question becomes how a multitude of individuals, each separately
pursuing his own happiness, can so arrange matters that their joint
action may secure the happiness of all. Clearly a man, however
selfish, has an interest generally in putting down theft and murder.
He is already provided with a number of interests to which security,
at least, and therefore a regular administration of justice, is
essential. His shop could not be carried on without the police; and he
may agree to pay the expenses, even if others reap the benefit in
greater proportion. A theory of legislation, therefore, which supposes
ready formed all the instincts which make a decent commercial society
possible can do without much reference to sympathy or altruism.
Bentham's man is not the colourless unit of <i>a priori</i> writing, nor
the noble savage of Rousseau, but the respectable citizen with a
policeman round the corner. Such a man may well hold that honesty is
the best policy; he has enough sympathy to be kind to his old mother,
and help a friend in distress; but the need of romantic and elevated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
conduct rarely occurs to him; and the heroic, if he meets it, appears
to him as an exception, not far removed from the silly. He does not
reflect&mdash;especially if he cares nothing for history&mdash;how even the
society in which he is a contented unit has been built up, and how
much loyalty and heroism has been needed for the work; nor even, to do
him justice, what unsuspected capacities may lurk in his own
commonplace character. The really characteristic point is, however,
that Bentham does not clearly face the problem. He is content to take
for granted as an ultimate fact that the self-interest principle in
the long run coincides with the greatest 'happiness' principle, and
leaves the problem to his successors. There we shall meet it again.</p>

<p>Finally, Bentham's view of religion requires a word. The short reply,
however, would be sufficient, that he did not believe in any theology,
and was in the main indifferent to the whole question till it
encountered him in political matters. His first interest apparently
was roused by the educational questions which I have noticed, and the
proposal to teach the catechism. Bentham, remembering the early
bullying at Oxford, examines the catechism; and argues in his usual
style that to enforce it is to compel children to tell lies. But this
leads him to assail the church generally; and he regards the church
simply as a part of the huge corrupt machinery which elsewhere had
created Judge and Co. He states many facts about non-residence and
bloated bishoprics which had a very serious importance; and he then
asks how the work might be done more cheaply. As a clergyman's only
duty is to read weekly services and preach sermons, he suggests
(whether seriously may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
be doubted) that this might be done as well by
teaching a parish boy to read properly, and provide him with the
prayer-book and the homilies.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> A great deal of expense would be
saved. This, again, seems to have led him to attack St. Paul, whom he
took to be responsible for dogmatic theology, and therefore for the
catechism; and he cross-examines the apostle, and confronts his
various accounts of the conversion with a keenness worthy of a
professional lawyer. In one of the <small>MSS.</small> at University College the same
method is applied to the gospels. Bentham was clearly not capable of
anticipating Renan. From these studies he was led to the far more
interesting book, published under the name of <i>Philip Beauchamp</i>.
Bentham supplied the argument in part; but to me it seems clear that
it owes so much to the editor, Grote, that it may more fitly be
discussed hereafter.</p>

<p>The limitations and defects of Bentham's doctrine have been made
abundantly evident by later criticism. They were due partly to his
personal character, and partly to the intellectual and special
atmosphere in which he was brought up. But it is more important to
recognise the immense real value of his doctrine. Briefly, I should
say, that there is hardly an argument in Bentham's voluminous writings
which is not to the purpose so far as it goes. Given his point of
view, he is invariably cogent and relevant. And, moreover, that is a
point of view which has to be taken. No ethical or political doctrine
can, as I hold, be satisfactory which does not find a place for
Bentham, though he was far, indeed, from giving a complete theory of
his subject. And the main reason of this is that which I have already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
indicated. Bentham's whole life was spent in the attempt to create a
science of legislation. Even where he is most tiresome, there is a
certain interest in his unflagging working out of every argument, and
its application to all conceivable cases. It is all genuine reasoning;
and throughout it is dominated by a respect for good solid facts. His
hatred of 'vague generalities'<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> means that he will be content with
no formula which cannot be interpreted in terms of definite facts. The
resolution to insist upon this should really be characteristic of
every writer upon similar subjects, and no one ever surpassed Bentham
in attention to it. Classify and re-classify, to make sure that at
every point your classes correspond to realities. In the effort to
carry out these principles, Bentham at least brought innumerable
questions to a sound test, and exploded many pestilent fallacies. If
he did not succeed further, if whole spheres of thought remained
outside of his vision, it was because in his day there was not only no
science of 'sociology' or psychology&mdash;there are no such sciences
now&mdash;but no adequate perception of the vast variety of investigation
which would be necessary to lay a basis for them. But the effort to
frame a science is itself valuable, indeed of surpassing value, so far
as it is combined with a genuine respect for facts. It is common
enough to attempt to create a science by inventing technical
terminology. Bentham tried the far wider and far more fruitful method
of a minute investigation of particular facts. His work, therefore,
will stand, however different some of the results may appear when
fitted into a different framework. And, therefore, however crudely and
im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>perfectly,
Bentham did, as I believe, help to turn speculation into
a true and profitable channel. Of that, more will appear hereafter;
but, if any one doubts Bentham's services, I will only suggest to him
to compare Bentham with any of his British contemporaries, and to ask
where he can find anything at all comparable to his resolute attempt
to bring light and order into a chaotic infusion of compromise and
prejudice.</p>

<h2><a name="NOTE_ON_BENTHAMS_WRITINGS" id="NOTE_ON_BENTHAMS_WRITINGS"></a>NOTE ON BENTHAM'S WRITINGS</h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
The following account of Bentham's writings may be of some use. The
arrangement is intended to show what were the topics which attracted
his attention at successive periods.</p>

<p>The collected <i>Works</i>, edited by Bowring, appeared from 1838 to 1843
in eleven volumes, the last two containing the life and an elaborate
index. The first nine volumes consist partly of the works already
published; partly of works published for the first time from Bentham's
<small>MSS.</small>; and partly of versions of Dumont's redactions of Bentham.
Dumont's publications were (1) <i>Trait&eacute;s de Legislation civile et
p&eacute;nale</i> (1802; second edition, revised, 1820): [vol. i. contains
<i>Principes g&eacute;n&eacute;raux de Legislation</i> and <i>Principes du Code civil</i>;
vol. ii. <i>Principes du Code p&eacute;nal</i>; and vol. iii. <i>M&eacute;moire sur le
Panoptique</i>, <i>De la Promulgation des Lois</i>, <i>De l'Influence du Temps
et des Lieux</i>, and <i>Vue g&eacute;n&eacute;rale d'un Corps complet des Lois</i>]; (2)
<i>Th&eacute;orie des Peines et des R&eacute;compenses</i>, 1811, 1818, 1825; (3)
<i>Tactiques des Assembl&eacute;es d&eacute;liberantes et Trait&eacute; des Sophismes
politiques</i>, 1816; (4) <i>Trait&eacute; des Preuves judiciaires</i>, 1823; and (5)
<i>De l'Organisation judiciaire et de la Codification</i>, 1823.</p>

<p>In the following I give references to the place of each work in
Bowring's edition.</p>

<p>Bentham's first book was the <i>Fragment on Government</i>, 1776 (i.
221-295). An interesting 'historical preface,' intended for a second
edition (i. 240-259), was first printed in 1828. The <i>Fragment</i>,
edited by Mr. F. C. Montague, was republished in 1891.</p>

<p>The <i>Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation</i> was
published in 1789, in one vol. 4to (i. 1-154). It had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
printed in
1780. A second edition, in two vols. 8vo, appeared in 1823. It was
intended as an introduction to the plan of a penal code. Bentham says
in his preface that his scheme would be completed by a series of works
applying his principles to (1) civil law; (2) penal law; (3)
procedure; (4) reward; (5) constitutional law; (6) political tactics;
(7) international law; (8) finance; and (9) political economy, and by
a tenth treatise giving a plan of a body of law 'considered in respect
of its form,' that is, upon 'nomography.' He wrote more or less in the
course of his life upon all these topics. Dumont's <i>Trait&eacute;s</i> of 1802
were based partly upon the <i>Introduction</i> and partly upon Bentham's
<small>MSS.</small> corresponding to unfinished parts of this general scheme.</p>

<p>The two first sections of this scheme are represented in the <i>Works</i>
by <i>Principles of the Civil Code</i> (i. 297-364) and <i>Principles of
Penal Law</i> (i. 365-580). The <i>Principles of the Civil Code</i> is
translated from Dumont's <i>Trait&eacute;s</i>, where it follows a condensed
statement of 'general principles' taken from the opening chapters of
the <i>Introduction</i>. An appendix 'on the levelling system' is added in
the <i>Works</i> from Bentham's <small>MSS.</small> The <i>Principles of Penal Law</i> consists
of three parts: the first and third (on 'political remedies for the
evil of offences' and on 'indirect means of preventing crimes') are
translated from parts 2 and 4 of Dumont's <i>Principes du Code p&eacute;nal</i>
(parts 1 and 3 of Dumont being adaptations from the <i>Introduction to
Morals and Legislation</i>). The second part of the <i>Penal Law</i>, or <i>The
Rationale of Punishment</i> is from Dumont's <i>Th&eacute;orie des Peines et des
R&eacute;compenses</i>. Dumont took it from a <small>MS.</small> written by Bentham in 1775.
(See Bentham's <i>Works</i>, i. 388.) An appendix on 'Death Punishment,'
addressed by Bentham to the French people in 1830, is added to Part
II. in the <i>Works</i> (i. 525-532). No. 4 of Bentham's general scheme
corresponds to the <i>Rationale of Reward</i>, founded upon two <small>MSS.</small>, one
in French and one in English, used by Dumont in the <i>Th&eacute;orie des
Peines et des R&eacute;compenses</i>. The English version in the <i>Works</i>,
chiefly translated from Dumont and compared with the original
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
manuscript, was first published in 1825 (ii. 189-266). Richard Smith
'of the Stamps and Taxes' was the editor of this and of an edition of
the <i>Rationale of Punishment</i> in 1831, and of various minor treatises.
(Bentham's <i>Works</i>, x. 548 <i>n.</i>)</p>

<p>The <i>Table of the Springs of Action</i> (i. 195-220), written at an early
period, was printed in 1815, and published, with modifications, in
1817. The <i>Vue g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i> included in the <i>Trait&eacute;s</i> of 1802 was
intended by Bentham as a sketch for his own guidance, and is
translated as <i>View of a Complete Code of Laws</i> in the <i>Works</i> (iii.
154-210). The two essays in the 1802 <i>Trait&eacute;s</i> on 'the promulgation of
laws' and the 'influence of time and place in matters of legislation'
are translated in <i>Works</i> (i. 157-194). A fragment on <i>International
Law</i>&mdash;a phrase invented by Bentham&mdash;written between 1786 and 1789,
first appeared in the <i>Works</i> (ii. 535-571), with <i>Junctiana
proposal</i>&mdash;a plan for a canal between the Atlantic and the
Pacific&mdash;written in 1822, as an appendix.</p>

<p>Besides the above, all written before 1789 in pursuance of his scheme,
Bentham had published in 1778 his <i>View of the Hard Labour Bill</i> (iv.
1-36); and in 1787 his <i>Defence of Usury</i> (iii. 1-29). A third edition
of the last (with the 'protest against law taxes') was published in
1816.</p>

<p>During the following period (1789-1802) Bentham wrote various books,
more or less suggested by the French revolution. The <i>Essay on
Political Tactics</i> (ii. 299-373), (corresponding to No. 6 of the
scheme), was sent to Morellet in 1789, but first published by Dumont
in 1816. With it Dumont also published the substance of the
<i>Anarchical Fallacies</i> (ii. 489-534), written about 1791. A <i>Draught
of a Code for the Organisation of the Judicial Establishment of
France</i>, dated March 1790, is reprinted in <i>Works</i> iv. 285-406. <i>Truth
v. Ashhurst</i>, written in 1792 (v. 231-237), was first published in
1823. A <i>Manual of Political Economy</i>, written by 1793 (see <i>Works</i>,
iii. 73 <i>n.</i>), corresponds to No. 9 of his scheme. A chapter appeared
in the <i>Biblioth&egrave;que Britannique</i> in 1798. It was partly used in
Dumont's <i>Th&eacute;orie des R&eacute;compenses</i>, and first published in English in
<i>Works</i> (iii.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> 31-84).
<i>Emancipate your Colonies</i> (iv. 407-481) was
privately printed in 1793, and first published for sale in 1830. A
<i>Protest against Law Taxes</i>, printed in 1793, was published in 1795
together with <i>Supply without Burthen, or Escheat vice Taxation</i>,
written in 1794. To them is appended a short paper called <i>Tax with
Monopoly</i> (ii. 573-600). <i>A Plan for saving all Trouble and Expense in
the Transfer of Stock</i>, written and partly printed in 1800, was first
published in <i>Works</i> (iii. 105-153).</p>

<p>During this period Bentham was also occupied with the Panopticon, and
some writings refer to it. <i>The Panopticon, or the Inspection House</i>
(iv. 37-172), written in 1787, was published in 1791. <i>The Panopticon
versus New South Wales</i> (iv. 173-248) appeared in 1802; and <i>A Plea
for the Constitution</i> (on transportation to New South Wales) (iv.
249-284), in 1803. Closely connected with these are <i>Poor-laws and
Pauper Management</i> (viii. 358-461), reprinted from Arthur Young's
<i>Annals</i> of September 1797 and following months; and <i>Observations on
the Poor Bill</i> (viii. 440-459), written in February 1797, privately
printed in 1838, and first published in the <i>Works</i>.</p>

<p>About 1802 Bentham returned to jurisprudence. James Mill prepared from
the papers then written an <i>Introductory View of the Rationale of
Evidence</i>, finished and partly printed in 1812 (see <i>Works</i>, x. 468
<i>n.</i> and Bain's <i>James Mill</i>, 105, 120). Dumont's <i>Trait&eacute; des Preuves
judiciaires</i> (1823) was a redaction of the original papers, and an
English translation of this appeared in 1825. The parts referring to
English Law were omitted. The <i>Rationale of Evidence</i> (5 vols. 8vo,
1827), edited by J. S. Mill, represents a different and fuller
redaction of the same papers. It is reprinted in vols. vi. and vii. of
the <i>Works</i> with the <i>Introductory View</i> (now first published)
prefixed. To the same period belongs <i>Scotch Reform</i>, with a <i>Summary
View of a Plan for a Judicatory</i>, 1808 (second edition 1811, v. 1-60).</p>

<p>After 1808 Bentham's attention was especially drawn to political
questions. His <i>Catechism of Parliamentary Reform</i> (iii. 433-557),
written in 1809, was first published with a long 'introduction' in the
<i>Pamphleteer</i> for January 1817. Bentham's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> <i>Radical Reform Bill, with
explanations</i> (iii. 558-597) followed in December 1819. <i>Radicalism
not dangerous</i> (iii. 598-622), written at the same time, first
appeared in the <i>Works</i> (iii. 398-622). <i>Elements of the Art of
Packing as applied to Special Juries, especially in Cases of Libel
Law</i> (v. 61-186), written in 1809, was published in 1821. <i>Swear not
at all</i> (v. 188-229) (referring chiefly to Oxford tests), written in
1813, was published in 1817. <i>The King against Edmonds</i> and <i>The King
against Wolseley</i> (v. 239-261) were published in 1820. <i>Official
Aptitude minimized; Official Expense limited</i> (v. 263-286), is a
series of papers, first collected in 1831. It contains a <i>Defence of
Economy against Burke</i>, and a <i>Defence of Economy against George
Rose</i>, both written in 1810, and published in the <i>Pamphleteer</i> in
1817, with <i>Observations</i> on a speech by Peel in 1825, and
<i>Indications respecting Lord Eldon</i>. The two last appeared in 1825.
Connected with these political writings is the <i>Book of Fallacies</i>
(ii. 375-488), edited by Bingham in 1824, from the 'most unfinished of
all Bentham's writings.' Allusions seem to show that the original <small>MSS.</small>
were written from 1810 to 1819. It was partly published by Dumont with
the <i>Tactique, etc.</i></p>

<p>Bentham, during this period (1808-1820), was also led into various
outlying questions. <i>The Pannomial Fragments</i>, <i>Nomography</i>, and
<i>Appendix on Logical Arrangements employed by Jeremy Bentham</i> (iii.
211-295) were first published in the <i>Works</i> from <small>MSS.</small> written from
1813 to 1831. With the <i>Chrestomathia</i> (viii. 1-192), first published
in 1816, are connected fragments upon 'Ontology,' 'Language,' and
'Universal Grammar' (viii. 193-358), first published in <i>Works</i> from
fragments of <small>MSS.</small> of 1813 and later. George Bentham's <i>Outline of a
New System of Logic</i> was partly founded upon his uncle's papers.
Bentham at the Ford Abbey time (1814-1818) was also writing his
<i>Church of Englandism and its Catechism examined</i>, 1818. The <i>Analysis
of the Influence of Natural Religion upon the Temporal Happiness of
Mankind</i>, by Philip Beauchamp, edited by George Grote, appeared in
1822; and <i>Not Paul but Jesus</i>, by Gamaliel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> Smith, in 1823. Francis
Place helped in preparing this at Ford Abbey in 1817 (Mr. Wallas's
<i>Life of Place</i>, p. 83). <i>Mother Church of England relieved by
Bleeding</i> (1823) and the <i>Book of Church Reform</i> (1831) are extracted
from <i>Church of Englandism</i>. Bowring did not admit these works to his
collection.</p>

<p>In his later years (1820-1832) Bentham began to be specially occupied
with codification. <i>Papers upon Codification and Public Instruction</i>
(iv. 451-534) consist chiefly of letters, written from 1811 to 1815,
offering himself for employment in codification in America and Russia,
and first published in 1817. In 1821 appeared <i>Three Tracts relating
to Spanish and Portuguese Affairs, with a Continual Eye to English
ones</i>; and in 1822 <i>Three Letters to Count Toreno on the proposed
Penal Code</i> (in Spain) (viii. 460-554). A short tract on <i>Liberty of
the Press</i> was addressed to the Spanish people in 1821 (ii. 275-299).
<i>Codification Proposals</i> (iv. 535-594) appeared in 1823, offering to
prepare an 'all-comprehensive code of law' for 'any nation professing
liberal opinions.' <i>Securities against Misrule addressed to a
Mahommedan State, and prepared with a special Reference to Tripoli</i>,
written in 1822-23, was first published in the <i>Works</i> (viii.
551-600). A tract on the <i>Leading Principles of a Constitutional Code</i>
(ii. 267-274) appeared in the <i>Pamphleteer</i> in 1823. The first volume
of the <i>Constitutional Code</i>, printed in 1827, was published with the
first chapter of the second volume in 1830. The whole book, edited by
R. Doane from papers written between 1818 and 1832, was published in
1841, and forms volume ix. of the <i>Works</i>. Doane also edited
<i>Principles of Judicial Procedure</i> (ii. 1-188) from papers written
chiefly from 1820 to 1827, though part had been written in 1802.
Several thousand pages upon this subject&mdash;the third part of the
original scheme&mdash;were left by Bentham at his death.</p>

<p>During his last years Bentham also wrote a <i>Commentary on Mr.
Humphrey's Real Property Code</i>, published in the <i>Westminster Review</i>
for October 1826 (v. 387-416); <i>Justice and Codification Petitions</i>
(v. 437-548), printed in 1829; <i>Jeremy Bentham to his Fellow-Citizens
in France on Houses of Peers and Senates</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> (iv. 419-450), dated 15th
October 1830; <i>Equity Dispatch Court Proposals</i> (iii. 297-432), first
published in <i>Works</i> and written from 1829 to 1831; <i>Outline of a Plan
of a General Register of Real Property</i> (v. 417-435), published in the
Report of the Real Property Commission in 1832; and <i>Lord Brougham
Displayed</i> (v. 549-612), 1832.</p>

<p>The <i>Deontology</i> or <i>Science of Morality</i> was published by Bowring in
two vols. 8vo in 1834, but omitted from the <i>Works</i>, as the original
edition was not exhausted. The <small>MS.</small> preserved at University College,
London, shows that a substantial beginning had been made in 1814; most
of the remainder about 1820. The second volume, made, as Bowring says,
from a number of scraps, is probably more 'Bowringised' than the
first.</p>

<p>Dumont's <i>Trait&eacute;s</i> were translated into Spanish in 1821, and the
<i>Works</i> in 1841-43. There are also Russian and Italian translations.
In 1830 a translation from Dumont, edited by F. E. Beneke, as
<i>Grunds&auml;tze der Civil- und Criminal-Gesetzgebung</i>, etc., was published
at Berlin. Beneke observes that Bentham had hitherto received little
attention in Germany, though well known in other countries. He reports
a saying attributed to Mme. de Sta&euml;l that the age was that of Bentham,
not of Byron or Buonaparte. The neglect of Bentham in Germany was due,
as Beneke says, to the prevalence of the Kantian philosophy. Bentham,
however, had been favourably noticed in the <i>Hermes</i> for 1822, and his
merits since acknowledged by Mittermaier and Warnk&ouml;nig in the
<i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Rechtswissenschaft</i>. Beneke (1798-1854) was opposed
to the Hegelian tendencies of his time, and much influenced by
Herbart. See Ueberweg's <i>History of Philosophy</i> (English translation,
1874, ii. 281, etc.) and the account of Bentham in Robert von Mohl's
<i>Staatswissenschaften</i>, etc. (1853), iii. 595-635.</p>

<p>A great mass of Bentham <small>MSS.</small> belongs to University College, London.
They are contained in 148 boxes, which were examined and catalogued by
Mr. T. Whittaker in 1892. A
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
few of these contain correspondence, part
of which was printed by Bowring. Others are the manuscripts of
published works. Some are upon the same subjects as the published
works, and others refer to topics not included in his publications.
Besides the <i>Deontology</i> manuscripts and a fragment upon 'Political
Deontology,' there is a discussion of the means of suppressing duels,
an argument against the legal punishment of certain offences against
decency, and a criticism of the gospel narrative similar to <i>Not
Paul</i>, etc. I have not thought it necessary to examine these fragments
after reading Mr. Whittaker's report. Bentham's principles are
sufficiently stated in his published works; and the papers which have
been reposing in the cellars of University College can have had no
influence upon the world. There is another large collection of <small>MSS.</small> in
the British Museum from the papers of Bentham and his brother, Sir
Samuel. Ten folio volumes contain correspondence, much of it referring
only to Sir Samuel. A long correspondence upon the acquisition of the
'Panopticon' land is included. Another volume contains many of
Bentham's school and college exercises. There are also the manuscripts
of the <i>Nomography</i>, <i>Logical Arrangements</i>, etc. This collection was
used by Bowring and by Lady Bentham in the life of her husband.</p>
